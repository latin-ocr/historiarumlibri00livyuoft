agente, ut ducem abesse nec cives¹ nec hostes sentirent. Is
et proelia aliquot secunda fecit, et tribus arietibus aliquantum
muri discussit, strataque omnia recentibus ruinis advenienti
Hannibali ostendit. Itaque ad ipsam arcem² externplo ductus-

Tentata deiude per duos est exigua pacis spes, Alconem

¹ Supply sui—that is, the Carthaginians‚ whose leader he was.
‘ his fellow-citizens‚ countrymen.’

² We read here for the first time ofa citadel in Saguntum. In all
the cities os antiquity‚ however, there was one part, commonly
situated higlter than the rest. which was fortified with peculiar
strength. being intended as the last place of desence. Thus Rome
had its citadel on the Capitoline Hiu, and Carthage its Brysa.

³ ‘'l'h‘at he would effect something? As to the omission of se,
see Grani. ᾗ 385, note l. Eum is omitted with the same tense, the
future infinitive active. near the end of the present sentence.

⁴ Tristis is frequently transferred from persons to grievous or an· ,

noying things. 'l'he imperfect after postquam must be noticed. Its
use here is perfectly correct, pointing to the actions as in pro-
gress.

⁵ Orator means here, as often, ‘a delegate' or ‘ envoy ;’ for though
Alco had not properly been sent by the Saguntines, still he con-
ducted himself as if he were an ambassador. '

“Sub condicionibus his is not so common as the simple ablative.
The sub here retains somewhat of its tense of ‘burthen-bearing!
See Zumpt, ᾧῷ 319 aud 472, note l, middle.

⁷ ¹ Where other things (such as walls and towers) are conquered‚
souls (resolutioris), 100, are overcome.’

⁸ · A hospes of the Saguntine state ;’ for we read frequently in an·
cient history of single individuals being public hospites of a city:
thus, for instance, Rome formed a hospitium with Timasitheus the
Liparensium. because he had delivered a golden cup, sent by the
Romansrtzoapelphi, out of the hands of pirates. See Liv„ v. 28.

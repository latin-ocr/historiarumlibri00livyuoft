tris, priusquam educeret in aciem, adhortandorum militum
causa talem orationem est exorsus.

40. ‘Si eum exercitum, milites, educerem in aciem, quem
in Gallia mecum habui, supersedissem loqui apud vos: quid
enim adhortari reserret¹ aut eos equites qui equitatum
hostium ad Rhodanum flumen egregie vicissent, aut eas
legiones cum quibus fugientem hunc ipsum hostem secutus
consessionem cedentis ac detrectantis certamen pro victoria
habui 2² Nunc quia ille exercitus Hispaniae provinciae
scriptus³ ibi cum fratre Cn. Scipione meis auspiciis⁴ rem
gerit, ubi eum gerere senatus populusque Romanus voluit,
eg0‚ ut consulem ducem adversus Hannibalem ac Poenos
haberetis, ipse me huic voluntario certamini obtuli, novo
imperatori apud novos milites pauca verba facienda sunt.
Ne genus belli neve hostem ignoretis, cum iis est vobis,
milites, pugnandum, quos terra marique priore bello vicistis;
a quibus stipendium per viginti annos exegistis;⁶ a quibus
capta belli praemia Siciliam ac Sardiniam habetis. Erit
igiturae in hoc certamine is vobis illisque animus, qui vic-
toribus et victis esse solet. Nec nunc illi, quia audent,
sed quia necesse est, pugnaturi sunt, nisi creditis, qui exer-
citu incolumi pugnarn detrectavere, eos duabus partibus
peditum equitumque in transitu Alpium amissis, cum plures

river, icinum.

¹ ‘ What need would there be‚‘ or ⁴ what good would it do ξ’ As
to the impersonal reffert, see Gram. ὑ 284.

² The subjunctive vicissent seems to require also habuissem,
instead of habui. But the former subjunctive is used merely for a
formal reason, in the continuation of a hypothetical sentence, and
is, as the sentence goes on, very naturally supplanted hythe indi-
cative: ‘I considered his confession, in avoiding me and a battle,
as equivalent to a victory.’

³ ⁴ Levied sor the province of Spain ;’ dativus commodi.

⁴ ⁸ Under my supreme command ;' sor P. Scipio, the consul now
speaking, had with the imperium received from the senate and
people os Rome also the jus auspicandi, so that he whom he
appointed his deputy had not his own auspicia. We shall find that
P. Scipio betook himself afterwards to the province of Spain, which
had been committed to him. As consul, he had, wherever he
went, authority over all commanders not of consular rank.

⁶ By the conditions of peace at the conclusion of the first Punic
war, the Carthaginians were to pay to the Romans a war contribu-
tion of 2200 talents‚ in twenty annual instalments. The statement
here, however, is at varianae with facts; for the terms afterwards
fixed by the Roman people difl'ered materially from those agreed to
by the consul Lutatius, and limited the time of payment to ten
vears. But Livy, in writing the present passage, probably re-
collected only the first arrangement.

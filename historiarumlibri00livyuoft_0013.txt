1 have examined the three volumes with considerable care. and can give them my uu-
qualified approbation. The plan is judic-ious and the execution worthy οἰ all praise. Tho
notes comprise all that a student needs. aud' all that he should have; and their position
at the root of the page is Just what ιι should be.

 

From Prior. E. E. Wiher, Emory and Hem-y College, Va.= Nou. 30. 1848.

The notoe seem to me very accurate. and are not so numerous as to do for the student
what he ought ω 110 sor himself. 1 can with safety. therefore, recommend ιι to my pupils.

Ι like the plan ofyour series. l feel sure it will succeed, and thus displace some nft‘he

they ought to he, 31111 sunush the learner Just about help enough.

From B. SANFORD, ESQ„ Bridgezcacer, Mass, Jan. 17. 1849.

1 have examined. with considerable care, both the Caesar and the virgil, and' am much
pleased with the plan and execution of the series thus sar. I am particularly gratified
with the pro riety 31111 judgment displayed by the editors 111 the preparation os the notes;
avoidiug, as think, the prolixity aud rofuseness os some of our classical works. and. at
the same time, the barrenuess and eficiency uf others3 giving a body of annotations
better suited tobaid the teacher in impartlng a knowledge ot* the language, than is to be
found 111 any edition heretofore 111 use.

 

Frum Paos. STURGESS, Hanorer Gillege. Indiam, Dec. 30, 1848.

The mere name of the editors is a-sufficient aud most ample guarantee of tne aocuracy
of the text, the judicious cholue of vannus readings. aud the ‹wui‘ormity οἱ those adopted
to the latest investigatious of Mes, and the results of the most enliglitened criticism.
The notes Ι have not examined very carefully, except those ot* the Virgil. They ase 311-
mirable. extremely condens-ed. and conveymg a great deal 01⁴ most. valuable criticism in
the briesest possible way. 'l'liey are particularly valuable ror their aesthetical remarks.
and the frequent references to parallel passages in the sanie author. The preliminary
*ise is excellent, and of gTeakvalue to the student. The Sallust appears to he of the same

neral character, 31111 the notes to furuish just such help as the diligent student really
needs. 1 think that in bringing out such a course at 3 che-ap rate you are confer-ring a

F'nrm Rev. Ros'r. Ausa, Providerat-2 Conference Seminary, R. 1., Dec. 25, 1843.

1 am much pleased with the general character of these works. The text in its general
character is highly satisfactory, the notes are really illustrante, aud admirably calculated
to assis! the student in acquiring a knowledge οἰ the matter iu the text, the manners aud
customs of the times, and the history and characters of the actors 111 the soenes. The
agogmphy 31111 exoernal appear-moe of the works are such as please the eye and-improve

[aste. You certainly deserve enoomagenient‚ and we shall do what lies in our power
ιο extend the circulation of the works.

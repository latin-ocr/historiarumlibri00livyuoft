Schmitz ancl Zumpt’s Classical Series-continued.

 

From Α. W. an, Eso., Kcnnetvunk, Me„ December 14, 1849,

I have examinet] with much carc and high satisfaction. the first five volumes of your
edition of Drs. Schinitz and Zumpt 's classical sei-ies. The plan and execution ot the series
are excellent. The notes appendcd to the several authors evince fully the sound Judg-
nient and accurate criticisni of the learned editors. They are sufficiently copious to meet
the wonts of the student, without, at, the same timey by their sulneSS,encouraglng habits
of indolence. Ι have. for inore than thirty years, been constantly engaged in teaching
the classics, and l 113νο not seen any edition of the Latin authors.usually read in our
acadeiiiies, which 1 could commend so confidently‚ as the orie you are publishing.

From E. ΕνΕΒΕΤΤ, EsQ.‚ New OrleanS, December 14, 1849.

All these publications are valuahle acquisitions to our classical and school libraries. 1
arri particularly pleased with the Virgil ς the notes are a store of learning; they furnish
the student with such hints on the manners and customs of the Romans as cannot fail to
serve as important aids to the study of Roman history, at. the sanie time that they throw
new light on the text ofthe great poet. They seem to me to be model notes: they arc
neither so copious as to enable the student to dispeuse with the exercise ofjudgment and
taste, nor so iiieagre as to leave difficolt passages unexplained.

 

 

From Taoms Cassa, Eso„ Cfflbridge‚ Mass„ September 28,1849.

Itake great pleasure in recommending the various volumes of Schmitz and Zumpt’s
Classical Series, which have appeared iii this country, as adinirahly adapted for the use
of schools. The character osthe editors is a guarantee of the accuracy of the text and
the correctness os the annotatioiis. The notes are prepared with careful scholarship and
nice discrimiiiation, and the amount of iiiforniatioii given on historical and grammatical
points is sufficient to satisfy the wants of the learner, while it is not so great asto be
prejudicial to his habits of study. We have introduced the editions of Caesar and of Vir-
gil, comprised in this series, into the High School in this city.

From R. B. Tscnum, 13qu EUM academ, May 31, 1849.

I received the fourth volume of your classica] series and take great pleasure in inform-
ing yon they have been the text-books recommended in this school since their first ap-
pearance. I have found the text and typographical execution equal. and in many respects
superior to any othei· editions that Ι have seen. But their cheapness is destined to make
them take the place of all other school editions. Of course it will take time to assume
the place of works already in use, but Ι 110110νο fully, at iio distant day these will be the
sole editions iii general use.

From A. MORse, Eso„ Nantucket ffigb. Schoel, July 20, 1849.

After a somewhat minute exaiiiination of the same, in which Ι have compared them.
line by liiie,with other editions,edi'ted by different gentleiiieny which my classes are now
reading, I have 110 hesitation iii giving to tlie series. edited by Drs. Schmitz and Zumpt,
a decided preference to any with which Ι am acquainted.

From R. H. BALL, Eso„ Northnmberland Academy, November 28, 1849.

This edition of the classice, so far, Ι greatly prefer to any other I have seen. sor tho uso

’ of scliools. lt conihiiies the advantages of textual conectness⁷ cheapnessv and pre-eini-

nent ability in the annotations, three things especially desirable in school books. 1 have
adopted this series, as far as issued, to the exclusion of all others.

 

 

From the Rev. Ε. Λ. DALRvMpmb Εζιξοιίῑὲἳίίὶ High school of Virginiu, Novem
er ἃ. , . .

I have examinet} them with some care. and have pleasure in statius that they are
judiciously and carefully prepared for the use of schools and colleges. The notes are to
the point, and what notes to classical authors should be. not so full as to amount to a
translation of the text, or so meagre as to give no satisfactory information to the student.
Α3 the best evidence of my approval, I would state that it is niy purpose to introduce
them, 33 occasion inay arise, into the institution under iiiy direction.

From Z. D. T. Krncsmzv, EsQ.‚ Wes—tNPoint¹ ,Μ Ῡ., November 6.1848.

Ι 3111 very much leased with the Caesar and virgil, and presunie 1 shall 110 equally so
with the Sallust. fshali adopt these Latin books for my school.

From Paos. A. F. Ross, Betlianffcv—uege‚ Virginiu, December 7, 1848.

My opinion of the Caesar you have already had expressed. and Ι will only add that my
interest in the completion of the series has been eiilianced hythe volumes which you

Pnisffigffinarded me. l shall recomineiid them for adoption as the standard course iii thio

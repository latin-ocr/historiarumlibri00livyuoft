consilium ante rem foret, ita acta re ad fidem pronius est.¹
Ratem unam ducentos longam pedeS‚ quinquaginta latam,
a terra in amnem porrexerunt3 quam, ne secunda aqua
deferretur, pluribus validis retinaculis parte superiore ripae
religatam pontis in modum humo injecta constraverunt, ut
beluae audacter velut per solum ingrederentur. Altera ratis
aeque lata, longa pedes centum, ad trajiciendum flumen apta,
huic copulata est, et curn elephanti per stabilem ratem tam-
quam viam, praegredientibus feminis, acti in minorem appli-
catam² transgressi sunt? extemplo resolutis, quibus leviter
annexa erat, vinculis ab actuariis aliquot navibus ad alteram
ripam pertrahitur. Ita primis expositis alii deinde repetiti
ac trajecti sunt.⁴ Nihil sane trepidabant, donec continenti
velut ponte agerentur: primus erat pavor, cum soluta ab
ceteris rate in altum raperentur.⁵ Ibi urgentes inter se, ce-
dentibus extremis ab aqua, trepidationis aliquantum edebant‚⁶
donec quietem ipse timor circumspectantibus aquam fecisset.
Excidere etiam saevientes quidam in flumen3 sed pondere

 

only, that by quisque the elephants are pointed at singly, and by the
conjunction nt the moment is indicated at which each slipped off the
firm ground, and came under the influence of the current. As to
quisque: omnes, see Zumpt, ᾗ 7]Ο; and as to destitueret, the sub-
junctive of repeated action, after participles of times (as here ut:
cum. ubi), see Zumpt, <> 569. and Gram. ᾗ 360, 8.

¹ ⁶ As this would be a plan affording greater security before its
execution. so after the thing has been done. it can more easily be
believed ;' that is, the plan of carrying over the elephams on fioats
would, on the one hand, be preferable to the other before its exe-
cution, on the score of safety; and, on the other hand, as it is cer-
tain that the animals were, in one way or another, taken over, the

former plan is more worthy of credit.
² ⁴ Into the smaller raft, which had been made fast to the other.'

³ ⁴ As soon as the elephants had passed into the smaller raft, it
was immediately drawn over to the other bank by some light row-
boats.’ Cum transgressi sunt is used as zeum primum (ut primum)

transgressi sunt.

⁴ · Others were again gone for, and taken over. Properly, we
could only say elephanti (totus grex elephantorum) r etiti ει olii tra-
jecti sunt; sor the repetition of the act refers to ἵζε elephants in
general, not to the remaining part merely.

⁵ ‘ The first disquietude among the elephants arose when, the raft
being loosed from the others, they were carried quickly away into
tlte deep water.' To ceteris we cannot supply anything but ratibus,
and we must therefore conceive that the large raft, two hundred feet
long, consisted of several firmly tied together. fin fact we learn from
Polybius, in his account of this crossing, that it actually was So.

⁶ ‘There a somewhat restless motion arose among them, the ani-
mals pressing upon one another, because those furthest out shrunk

back from the water.’

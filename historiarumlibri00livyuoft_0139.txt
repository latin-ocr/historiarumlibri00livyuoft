eam diem summa ope inservitum erat, injuriae a primoribus
fieri coepere. Eodem anno Signia¹ colonia, quam rex Tar-
quinius deduxerat‚ suppleto numero colonorum, iterum deducta
est. Romae tribus una et viginti factae.² Aedes Mercurii
dedicata est Idibus Maiis.

22. Cum Volscorurn gente Latino bello neque pax neque
bellum fuerat: narn et Volsci comparaverant auxilia, quae
mitterent Latinis, ni maturatum ab dictatore Romano esset:
et maturavit Romanus, ne proelio uno cum Latino Vols·
coque contenderet. Hac ira consules in Volscum agrum
legiones duxere. Volscos consilii poenam³ non-metuentes
necopinata res perculit: armorum immemores obsides
dant trecentos principum a Cora atque Pometia⁴ liberos.
Ita sine certamine inde abductae legiones. Nec ita multo
post Volscis levatis metu suum rediit ingenium: rursus
occultum parant bellum, Hernicis⁵ in societatem armo-
rum assumptis. Legatos quoque ad sollicitandum Latium
passim dimittunt. Sed recens ad Regillum lacum accepta

¹ As to Signia, see i. 56, p. 93, note 3. This town and Cora (ii.
16), which was not sar from it, lay in the direction of the Volscians,
and were no doubt intended as military outposts against these

² In chap. 16 wo were told of the bestowal of the rights of citizen-
ship upon Appius Claudius and his Sabines, and the assignment of
land to thern. 'I'he change, however, in the arrangements os the

⁴ Taken strictly, and according to the position of the words, a
Cora atque Pometia belongs to principes, and stands sor Coronarum
atque Pometinorum; but the mode of expression proceeds from the
wish-to indicate the places from which the hostages were taken, and
therefore depends rather upon dant. As to the story. we refer to
chap. 16. The war mentioned there against the Aurunci is identical
with that here described as carried on with the Volscians. It is im-
possible that both could have been carried on, for (chap. 16) ¹Pometia.
was almost annihilated; here it appears again as a considerable
town. Livy had several ancient annalists before him, some of whom
placed this event in the one year, others in the other: without him-
self deciding as to the true date, he repeats the. same occurrence in
thehscparatefyears, in order to pass over nothing which was given

INTRODUCTION. xi

of the leading men were to be seen vividly impressed ηραν, their
published speeches and literary productioris, or were at least de-
scribed in detail in the historical works of their cotemporaries.
Here a historian skilled in rhetoric and philosophy could bring all
his powers of description and narration into full play. There can
be no doubt that Quintilian, in ascribing to Livy a lactea ubertas—
that is, a rich fulness of beautiful narrative—had reference princi-
pally to that part ofthe history which we have mentioned. Three-
fonrths of Livy's work, however, including all the books after the
forty-fifth, are lost. Even the first sorry-five books, comprehending
the period from the building of the city till the conquest of Perseus,
king of Macedonia, and the triumph of EEmilius Paullus, 167 B.C.‚
have not come down to us complete, for the second decade (books
xi.--xx.), which embraced the time from the termination of the
Samnite wars till the commencement ofthe second Punic, is want-
ing. But even from what we have, we can perceive the truth of
the ancient critic's remark on Livy; we can see the purity of his
character in his appreciation of the noble and the base, the fiuency,
and, frequently, in the description of accessory circumstances, the
over-copiousness of his narrative, his correct taste and scrupulous
avoidance of all affectation in style. Livy’s style is founded on
Cicero’s in the same manner as that of Tacitus on‘Sallust’S. Livy's
period is expanded, whereas Sallust⁷s is broken up into single short
sentences. Livy carries on his periods by the introduction of all
kinds of additional circumstances in the form ofaccessory sentences,
through means of conjunctions with their dependent verbs, and
participles in the case of the subjects, and as ablatives absolute.
Livy‘s period is quite peculiar; Cicero's being oratorical, is much
more animated and varied. Livy's expands into a quiet, broad,
transparent stream, so that in translating into modern languages‚
which do not make such extensive use ot' accessory clauses as the
r Latin, one of his periods must be broken up into three or four mode-
rately-sized sentences. In reference to his employment of parti-
cular words, their meanings, and constructions, Livy for the most
part followed the general usage of the language. His language,
therefore, approaches nearer to that of Cicero than Sallust⁷s does,
though the latter was about thirty years older than Livy, and almost
a contemporary of the great pater patriae. Sallust formed his style
'and chose his words according to the earlier Latinityg Livy kept to
the language ofhis contemporaries, as it had been improved by the
orators of the Ciceronian period, and moditied and polished by the
rhetorieians and poets of the Augustan age. This difference be-
tween Livy and Sallust in their views ot' style is shown also by state-
ments which we find in ancient writers. Quintilian (x. l) relates
thattLivy, in a letter to liis son, commanded him to read principally
Demosthenes and Cicero, aud other authors only in the degree of
their resemblance to these; and Seneca (Controv. 24, 59> mentions
that Livy had a poor opinion of Sallust's studied brevity and aflecta-
tion of archaisms. The discrepancy which exists between the styles
of Livy and Cicero, independently of the natural difference οῖ’ nar-
rative and representation between the historiari and the orator, is
worthy of remark. 'l’his diss'erence is principally to be found in
Livy's frequent introduction of poetical words and construetione
into his prose: c. g. tempestus for tempus, mortales for hanzines, letum

²Thus the Latin city of Gabii came into the hands of Tarquin.
The manner in which this was effecied—-namety, by the pretended
ssight of Sextus to the Gabinens—is verss like the way described by
Herodotus, in which the Persian king arius retook Babylon (516
Β. c.). The message. too, which King Tarquini sent to his son bears

the tyram of Miletus. sent to Periander of Corinth (about 600 a. c.).

⁶ ‘ The immovability of Terminus, and the circumstance that he
was the only one of the gods who could not be brought out of his
consecrated bounds.’ Dionysius. and Livy himself 'in another pas-
sage (v. 54), mention that the altar of the goddess Juventas, too,
could nothe exaugurated—a promise of eternal youth to the city

and state.

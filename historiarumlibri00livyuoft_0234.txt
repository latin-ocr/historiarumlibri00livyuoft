30. Itaque Hannibal, postquam ipsi sententia stetit per-
gere ire² atque Italiam petere, advocata contione varie
militum versat animos castigando³ adhortandoque. Mirari
se, quinam pectora semper impavida repens terror⁴ inva-
serit. Per tot annos vincentes eos stipendia facere, neque
ante Hispania excessisse, quam omnes gentesque et⁵ terrae,
quas duo diversa maria amplectantur, Carthaginiensium
essent. Indignatos deinde, quod, quicunque Saguntum ob-
sedissent‚⁶ velut ob noxam sibi dedi postularet populus
Romanus, Iberum trajecisse ad delendum nomen Roma-
norum liberandumque orbem terrarum. Tum nemini visum
id longum, cum ab occasu solis ad exortus intenderent iter.⁷
Nunc postquam multo majorem partem itineris emensam⁸
cernant, Pyrenaeum saltum inter ferocissimas gentes supe·
ratum, Rhodanum, tanturn amnem, tot milibus Gallorum
prohibentibus, domita etiam ipsius fluminis vi trajectum,
in conspectu Alpes habeant, quarum alterum latus Ita·

 

¹ ⁴ A thing by which a report was dreadsul, to such as had never
made any trial of it.⁷ Utique, being compounded of uti=ut, and
the generalising particle que, means properly, ‘ however things may
stand,’ therefore ‘at all events, positively, certainly, at least,' or
some such limiting expression.

² ⁵ To march fartlier,’ as in chap. 22, fin„ pergeret porro ire.

³ Castigare, ‘to punish,’ which may be done by words, therefore
sometimes, either with or without verbis, ⁴ to chide,⁷ ‘ reproachss

⁴ Quinam repens terror, ‘what sudden fear.' Repens is common
in Livy, rare in other prose writers, and rather a poetical word sor
subitas. The ablative repente, however, as an adverb, occurs very
frequently in prose. Nam added to the interrogative, in indirect as
well as direct speech, gives soree and impressiveness to the question.

⁵ ine-et occurs sometimes in Livy instead os «ετ-ετ, which is
much more common. See Zumpt, (> 338.

⁶ ⁶ All who had besieged Saguntum.' The Romans had not de-
manded this, but only that the commander-in-chief should be given
up. Hannibal, however, in order to excite his soldiers, speaks,
both here, and in chap. 44, as is they had all been included in the
demand. As to the construction of postulare with the infinitive‚ in·
stea'd of the more common one with ut, see Zumpt, ὓ 613, with note,
and Gram. ᾗ 380, with note 1.

⁷ ¹ When they undertook the journey to the rising of the sun.’ A
rhetorical exaggeration, as is also the expression, afterwards, that
Rome was the capital of the globe. ‘We cannot conceive that Han-
nibal spoke in such a manner.

⁸ ‘ Completed.’ As to the deponent emetiri, the perfect participle
of which is used passively, see Zumpt, ᾧ 632. To the following
participles saltum seper-atum, and Rhodanum trajectum supply cer-
nam from the preceding clause. ·

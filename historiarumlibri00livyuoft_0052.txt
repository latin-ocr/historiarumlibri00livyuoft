38 Τ. Livii.

urbis Romanae salvere universi Romulum jubent3¹ pacem
precibus exposcunt, nti volens propitius suam semper so-
spitet progentem. Fuisse credo tum quoque aliquos qui dis-
cerptum regem Patrnm manibus taciti arguerent: manavit
enirn haec quoque, sed perobscura sarna.² Illam alteram
admiratio viri et pavor³ praesens nobilitavit. Consilio
etiam unius hominis addita rei dicitnr fides. Namque Pro-
culus Julius, solliciia civitate desiderio regis et insensa
Patribus, graviS, ut traditur, quamvis magnae rei auctor-,⁴²
in contionem prodit. ‘Romulus' inquit, *Quirites parens
urbis hujus, prima hodierna luce coelo repente delapsus se
mihi obvium dedit. Cum perfusus horrore venerabun-
dusque adstitissem, petens precibus ut contra intueri⁵ fas
esset, Abi, nuntia, inquit, Romanis, Coelestes ita velle ut
rnea Roma caput orbis terrarum sit. Proinde rem mili-
tarem colant, sciantque, et ita posteris tradant, nullas opes
humanas armis Romanis resistere posse. ‘Haec' inquit
‘locutus sublimis abiit.J Mirum quantum illi viro nurt-

plebem exercitumque sacta fide immortalitatis lenitum sit.

¹ They shouted salve deus, salve Romule ! a sxgn that they recog-
nised him as an immortal‚ and consequently as still alive. Had
they believed him to be absolutely dead, they would have uttered
the sad cry of vale! The word pacem in the next clause has the
force of gratiam, tutelam, ut ipsis benignus sit. ⁷

2 Haecfama manavit, ‘this report has gone abroad‚’ or ‘ become
current⁷ -namely, the report that Romulus was murdered by the
Fathers. Livy seems to think this story not an improbable one. In
the tradition of the translation of Romulus into heaven, wc find only
an attempt to account for the popular belief that he had become a
god„ and, as Quirinus, watched over the city which he had founded.

³ Pavor, ‘ sear,' probably of the Fathers‚ towards whom the com-
mon people had no friendly seelings‚ and who, they must instinctively
have thought, had killed their king. The pavor might also be ex-
plained as the natural consequence of the great tempest which had
lately burst over them.

⁴¹ ‘ A highly-trustworthy authority sor any story, however in-
credible it might seem⁷ (literally. ⁴ for a thing however great’).
Quamvis, used adverbially‚ equivalent here to quantumvis. Com-

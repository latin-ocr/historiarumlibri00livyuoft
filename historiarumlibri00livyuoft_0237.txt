ad laevam in Tricastinos flexit5¹ inde per extremam oram
Vocontiorum agri tendit in Τπίοοτὶοε,Ξ haud usquam impe-
dita via, priusquam ad Druentiam flumen pervenit. Is et ipse
Alpinus amnis longe omnium Galliae fluminum difficillimus
transitu est. Nam cum aquae vim vehat ingentem, non
tamen navium* patiens est, quia nullis coercitus ripis, pluribus
simul neque iisdem alveis fluens, nova semper vada novosque
gurgites (et ob eadem pediti quoque incerta est via), ad hoc
saxa glareosa volvens, nihil stabile nec tutum ingredienti
praebet.³ Et tum forte imbribus auctus ingentem transgre-
dientibus tumultum fecit, cum super cetera trepidatione ipsi
sua atque incertis clamoribus turbarentur.

32. P. Cornelius consul, triduo sere postquam Hannibal
a ripa Rhodani movit‚⁴ quadrato agmine ad castra hostium
venerat, nullam dimicandi moram facturus. Ceterum ubi
deserta munimenta nec facile se tantum progressos⁵ asse—
cuturum videt, ad mare ac naves rediit, tutius faciliusque
ita descendenti ab Alpibus Hannibali occursurus. Ne tamen

¹ ⁴ He turned to the left to the country ofthe Tricastini.y If Han-
nibal marched up along the Rhone to the point where the Iscre falls
into it, and then turned into the country of the Tricastini, he must
have marched to the right: so that Livy, in saying od laevam, looks
srorn Rome, his own stand-point, whereas, looking from the Car-
thaginians, it was ad dextram. The district of the Tricastini lay
south-east from the point where the Isere joins the Rhone, and in
modern geography is marked hythe places of St. Paul Tricastin,
and Nions in the French province of Dauphine. Had Hannibal
marched straight forward (recta regione) to the Alps, he would then
have proceeded up along the Isere to the foot of the Little St. Ber-
nard, and have crossed it ; but is. as Livy says, he went south srom
the Ιεέῐε, it is most likely that he crossed Mount Genevre. Ac-
cording to Polybius, whose view is now almost universally adopted,
he did go straight sorward, and cro‘ss the Little St. Bernard.

² Hannibal passed only through the south part os the district of the
Vocontii, whose chief towns afterwards, and probably even then,
were Vasio and Lucus (now Vaison and Le Luc). The Tricorii, at
the soot of the way across the Alps, are marked hy the situation os
Vapincum, now Gap, in Dauphine3 , The Druentia, which the Car·
&aginians found such difficulty ln crossing, is now called the

urence.

³ This mountain torrent divides itself into many parts, and is con-
stantly forming new beds, and thus always affords to the traveller
new fords and new deep places (gurgites); besides, it rolls down
stones mixed with gravet (these are saxa glareosa). To vada et gur·

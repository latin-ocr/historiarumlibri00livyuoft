sis latae cum vinculorum minis mortisque, edixit ut omnes
cives Romani, equites pedulesque, in suis quisque centuriis,
in campo Martio pristin. luce adessent. lbi instructum exer-
citum ornnem suovetaurilibus² lustravit: idque conditum
lustrum appellatum, quia is censendo³ finis sactus est. Milia
octo2i111a eo lustro civium censa dicuntur: adjicit scriptorum
antiquissimus Fabius l'tct‹›r‚⁴ eorum qui arma serre possent,
eurn numerum fuisse. Ad eam multitudinem urbs quoque
amplificanda visa est. Addit duos colles, Quirinalem Vimi-
nalemqueg inde deinceps auget Esquilias 5⁵ ibique ipse, ut
loco dignitas fieret, habitat. Aggere et fossis et rnuro cir·
oumdat urbem: ita pomoerium profert. pomoerium, verbi
vim solam intuentes, postmoerium interpretantur esse. Est
autern magis eirca mni-um locus, quem in condendis urbibus
quondam Etrusci, qua murum ducturi erant, certis circa
terminis inaugurato consecrabant, ut neque interiore parte
aedificia moenibus continuarentur, quae nunc vulgo etiam
coiijungunt,⁶ et extrinsecus puri aliquid ab humano cultu
ateret soli. Hoc spatium. quod neque habitari neque arari
as erat, non magis quod post murum esset, quam quod murus
post id⁷ pomoerium Romani appellarunt. Et in urbis incre-
mento semper, quantum moenia processura erant, tantum
termini hi consecrati proferebantur.

¹ He had passed a law, which was in force also at a later period,
that every one who did not give in a census os his fortune (incensus
=vton census) should be imprisoned, and afterwards put to death;
and thereby he had brought the business to a speedy termination.

² As the composition of the word shows, ⁸ the sacrifice of a sow,
a sheep. and a bull.'

² Censendo is the dative os the gerund, which takes the place of a
declined infinitive. The word condere in the expression condere
lustrum is explained by Livy himself as equivalent to finire, ‘to
complete!

⁴He was certainly the most ancient Roman historiari. sor he
lived during and sor a short time aster the second Punic war.
Scriptor. however, must here be taken in the limit'ed sense of a
prose writer or historiari. sor otherwise Fabius would not be ami-
quihr'mus. Livius Andronicus having published his tragedies twenty
years before hirn. .

⁵Gron0vius wished the ablative Esquiliis. Wlttchever reading
we adopt, we find that the collis Esquilinus is from this time a part
os the city, which comprehended, besides it and the two others
mentioned in the text, the Caelius, the Aventinus. and the two
inner hills, Palatinus, and Capitolinus.

⁶ Now, says Livv, the houses are not only brought up to the city
wall without anv space being lest, but are even bnilt a ainst the
wall (coniungum'ur) so that it forms the back wall oft e house.
Dionysius, too, remarks of this wall os Servius, that in later times
it was entirely built in, so as to be traced with difficulty.

aucto curiam fecit, quae Hostilia usque ad patrum nos·
trorum aetatem appellata est. Et ut omnium ordinum
viribus aliquid ex novo populo adjiceretur, equitum decem
turmas ex Albanis legit, legiones et veteres eodem supple·
mento explevit et novas scripsit.

Hac fiducia virium Tullus Sabinis bellum indicit, genti
ea tempestate secundum Etruscos opulentissimae viris ar·
misque. Utrimque injuriae factae ac res nequicquam erant
repetitae. Tullus ad Feroniae fanum¹ mercatu frequenti
negotiatores Romanos comprehensos querebatur, Sabini suos
prius in lucum² confugisse ac Romae retentos. Hae causae
belli ferebantur. Sabini haud parum³ memores et suarum
virium partem Rornae ab Tatio locatam, et Romanam rem
nuper etiam adjectione populi Albani auctam, circumspicere
et ipsi externa auxilia. Etruria erat vicina, proximi Etrus-
corum Veientes. Inde ob residuas bellorum iras maxime
sollicitatis ad defectionem animis voluntarios traxere3 et
apud vagos quosdam ex inopi plebe etiam merces valuit.
Publico auxilio nullo adjuti sunt, valuitque apud Veientes
(nam de ceteris minus mirum est) pacta cum Romulo in-
dutiarum fides.⁴ Cum bellum utrimque summa ope para·
rent, vertique in eo res videretur-,⁵ utri prius arma inferrent,
occupat Tullus in agrum Sabinu-m transire. Pugna atrox
ad silvam Malitiosam suit, ubi et peditum quidem robore,

any consecrated place, where, with the approval of the gods (aus-

ἰιαιο), religious or state business might be transacted. The tri-

unal or stone platform called the rostra was a templum, and is spoken
of as such by Livy in viii. 14 and 35. Compare i. 6. 1124, note 2.
The Curia Hostilia was burnt down before the time of Livy, and,
being rebuilt by Caesar. was afterwards called Curia Julia.

¹ Feronia was the name of an old Italian goddess. The temple
mentioned here, near which markets were held, was situated in the
territory belonging to the Etruscan town of Capena, at the soot of
the mountain Soracte, not sar from the Tiber, and twenty-nine miles
to the north of Rome. This temple of Feronia must not be con-
founded with another which was situated on the via Appia, near
Terracina.

2 This must mean some sacred grove in Rome or its neighbour-
hood. to which Sabines had fied, from fear of being maltreated.

³ ⁴ Not too little,⁷ equivalent to satis.

⁴ See i. 15.

⁵ Res vertitur in aliqua re, ‘ a matter hinges or depends on some-
thing.’ The figure is taken from a door, which turns on, and is sup-
ported by, its hinges. If they give way, the door falls immediately.
The expression cardo reiis also used in Latin for ‘the turning or
most important point of any matter.¹ The adjective ‘cardinal‚’ too,
in English, is employed in the sense of ‘ principa13’ thus ‘the car·
dinal points of the compass,’ ‘the cardinal numbers,’ διο.

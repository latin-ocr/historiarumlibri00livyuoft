tabatur.¹ Oriundi ab Sabinis, ne, quia post Tatii mortem
ab sua parte non erat regnatum, in societate aequa posses-
sionem imperii amitterent, sui corporis creari regem vole-
bant3 Romani veteres peregrinum regem aspernabantur.
In variis voluntatibus regnari² tamen ornnes volebant, liber-
tatis dulcedine nondum experta. Timor deinde Patres in-
cessit,3 ne civitatem sine imperio, exercitum sine duce,
multarum circa civitatium irritatis animis, vis aliqua ex-
terna adoriretur. Et esse igitur aliquod caput placebat, et
nemo alteri concedere in animum inducebat. Ita rem inter
se centum Patres, decem decuriis factis, singulisque in sin-
gulas decurias creatis7⁴¹ qui summae rerum praeessent, con-
sociant. Decem imperitabant, unus cum insignibus imperii
et lic-toribus erat3 quinque dierum spatio finiebatur irnpe-

regnum appellatum. Fremere deinde plebs multiplicatam
servitutem, centum pro uno dominos factos: nec ultra nisi
regem, et ab ipsis creatum, videbantur passuri. Cum sen-
sissent ea moveri Patres, offerendum ultro rati quod amissuri
erant, ita gratiam ineunt, summa potestate populo permissa,
ut non plus darent juris, quam retinerent.⁶ Decreverunt

 

¹ ‘ The striving for the government (certamen regni) had not yet
gone so far as single persons’ (that 15, the question was not whether
this or that leading man should be made king), ‘the struggle was
rather by factions between the orders—that is. the dispute was
rather whether the king should be chosen frorn the order or body
(ordo, corpus) of the Sabines, or srorn that os the original Latin
Romans. The manuscripts read a singulis, but ad singulos, a con·
jecture of Graevius, is unquestionably the correct reading.

² Re nari, ‘that there should be a king,' or ‘that the government
shoul be monarchicaL' Expertus, the participle of a deponent

werb, is used here passively. Compare i. 34, odfin.

³Incedere governs either the accusative or the dative. In Livy
the former construction is the more common, particularly when the
subject is a feeling or emotion of tlte mind, and the verb may be
translated ‘to seize, take possession σίζ’ as here. The dative, how-
ever, even in a case of this kind. occurs in iv. 57, gravior cura Pa-
tribus incessit. See Zumpt, <> 387.

⁴ ‘ One being chosen for each decuria.y In, used distributively,
as er.

‘'p‘ Even now (in the time of the republic) the name is in use ε’ for
during the republic an interrex was sometimes named by the senate,
when by any chance there was no ordinary curule magistrate in the
state ς when, for instance, the elections were obstructed, and the time
osone magistrate expired before a successor was appointed. Such an
interrex, like those mentioned by Livy here, held office for five days.

⁶ Most of the manuscripts read detinerent, but this compound (‘ to
hinder’) does not seem very suitable.

12. Tenuere tainen2 arcem Sabini, atque inde postero die,
curn Romanus exercitus instructus, qnod inter Palatinum
Capitolinumque collem campi est, complesset, non prins de-
scenderunt in aequum, quam, ira et cupiditate recuperandae
arcis stimulante animos, in adversum Romani subiere. Prin-
cipes utrimque pugnam ciebant, ab Sabinis Mettius Curtius,
ab Romanis Ηοεῑίιιε3 Hostilius. Hic rem Romanam iniquo
loco ad prima signa animo atque audacia sustinebat. Ut
Hostius cecidit, confestim Romana inclinatur acies, fusaque
est ad veterem portam Palatii. Romulus et ipse turba sugnen-
tium actus, arma ad coelum tollens, ‘Juppiter, tuis’ inquit
‘jussis avibus hic in Palatio prima urbi fundamenta ejci.
Arcem jam scelere emptam Sabini habent3 inde huc armati,
superata media valle, tendunt. At tu, Pater deum homi-
numque, hinc saltem arce hostes, deme terrorem Romanis,
fugamque foedam siste. Hic ego tibi templum Statori Jovi,⁴
quod monumentum sit posteris, tua praesenti ope servatam
urbem esse, voveo.⁷ Haec precatuS, veluti si sensisset auditas
preces, ‘Hinc’ inquit, ίΒοιῐιῑὶηὶ, Juppiter Optimus Maximus
resistere atque iterare pugnam jubet! Restitere Romani
tamquam coelesti voce jussi. Ipse ad primores Romulus pro-
volat. Mettius Curtius ab Sabinis princeps ab arce decucur-

‘d——o‘—

 

¹ This version of the story rescues Tarpeia's patriotism from re-
proach, and, as we learn from other sourceS, was an invention of
the annalist Piso.

² Tamen has reference to a clause understood—namely‚ ‘ however
this rnay be ς’ that is, ‘ whether Tarpeia was actuated by a treach-
erous or a patriotic motive’—it is nevertheless certain that the
Sabines were masters of the citadel.

³ The best manuscripts read Hostius, others Hostus. This was
an old praenomen, given to those who were born among foreigners
(apud hostes, according to the ancient expression).

4 ‘ To thee as Juppiter the stayer, or supporter.’ Romulus here
gave ,Iuppiter the cognomen os Stator, as on a former occasion he
had given him that of Feretrius. We may again remark here, that
the incidents of the narrative are connected with the explanation of
the names of ancient localities in the city, or rather, indeed, that
the whole story is but a collection of such explanations. Thus, 'm
the valley at the foot of the Palatine there was for a long time a
bog known as the lacus Curtius, which was afterwards filled up.
Its name was variously explained, being by some derived from
Mettius Curtius, a Sabine warrior mentioned in this chapter; by
others from M. Curtius, a Roman knight‚ who .S said to have leaped
into it (361 B. c.) because the abyss could not otherwise be filled
up.— See Livy, vii. 6.

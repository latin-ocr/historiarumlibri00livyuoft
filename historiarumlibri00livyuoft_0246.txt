octoginta milia peditum, decem equitum adducta in Italiam.
Magis affluxisse verisimile est,¹ et ita quidam auctores sunt.
Ex ipso autem audisse Hannibale, postquam Rhodanum
transierit, triginta sex milia hominum ingentemque nurne-
rum equorum et aliorum jumentorum amisisse, Taurinis,²
quae Gallis proxima gens erat, in Italiam degressum. ld
cum inter omnes constet, eo magis miror ambigi quanam
Alpes transierit, et vulgo credere Penino (atque inde nomen
ei jugo Alpium inditum) transgressum, Coelium per Cre-
monis jugnm dicere transisse 3³ qui ambo saltus eum non
in Taurinos, sed per Salassos montanos ad Libuos Gallos
deduxissent* Nec verisimile est ea tum ad Galliam patuisse
itinera3 utique quae ad Peninum serunt, obsepta gentibus
semigermanis fuissent. Neque hercule montibus his, si
quem sorte id movet, ab transitu Poenorum ullo Veragri,
incolae jugi ejus, norunt nomen inditum, sed ab eo quem in
summo sacratum vertice Peninum montani appellant.⁵

¹ Livy's remark. that from the size os Hannibal's army, when in·
creased by Ligurians and Gauls in Italy, no conclusion can be
arrived at as to the number of soldiers whom he had led with him
over the Alps. is quite just. L. Cincius Alimentus was a Roman
praetor, and wrote in the Greek language a history of his own time,
with a short introduction upon the more ancient Roman history,
which had not yet been attempted in Latin. This Cincius Alimen-
tus. however, is not the same as the antiquary Cincius (without the
name of Alimentus), who is cited by Livy in vii. 3.

² The mere ablative of the name os a tribe is here employed in an
unusual manner, like the ablative of the name of a district. to indi-
cate place ‘ wherez' ‘that in thc district of the Taurini Hannibal
had descended from the Alps into Italy.’ In saying that the Tau-
rini were the tribe nearest to the Gauls, and were themselves in
Italy, Livy thinks os the boundaries os his own time, which included
in Italy all the country south of the Alps, though at the time of
theI seleond Punic war Liguria and Cisalpine Gaul were not counted
in ta .

³ Lig'y censuros and rejects two opinions as to the route which
Hannibal took over the Alps: the one⁷ which was eneral in his
time, that hc crossed the Alpis Penina (the Great St. ernard), and
that the mountain had from that circumstance received its name
(which, according to this theory, must have been written Poeninum
the other, that of Coelius Antipater (who fiourished about the year
90 Β.ο., shortly before the time of Cicero, and wrote a history of
the second Punic war. that Hannibal crossed the Little St. Bernard.
The latter yiew‚dn0twithstanding Livy’s censure, has found most

tiretur, ita tum aegrae et affectae civitati quodcunque adversi
inciderit, non rerum magnitudine, sed viribus extenuatis,
quae nihil quod aggravaret pati possent, aestimandum esse.¹
Itaque ad remedium jam diu neque desideratum nec adhibi-
tum, dictatorem decendum, civitas confugit. Et quia et con--

(Narni), towards Rome. But at Spoletium he forsook his southern
direction, and turned eastwards into the districts on the gulf of

Vemce.

PREFACE.

Tru text of this edition of the first, second, twenty-first, and
twenty-second books of Livy is founded on Immanuel Bekker’s
‘Recension’ (Berlin. 1829. 3 vols. Svo.); and in every case of
importanee where a reading different from his is given, both the
variation and the reasons sor it are stated in the notes. Bekker's
text is founded generally, and particularly in these books, not on
recently-discovered or newly-used manuscripts, but on the ma-
terials afforded by the great edition of Arn. Drakenborch (Am-

Alschefski in his critical edition of Livy (vol. i. containing books
i.—v. Berlin, 18413 vol. ii., books vi.—x. 18433 vol. iii., books
xxi.-xxiii. 1846). Mr. Alschefski sor the first decade has
compared anew the celebrated 4 Codex Μεὶάἰοθυε,ἲ and has found
many things which had been previously overlooked. He has
also consulted the ‘ Codex Parisinus,' No. 5725 of the Paris Li-
brary3 and sor the third decade, compared with greater care
than was ever done before, the oldest manuscript of Livy in
Paris—namely, the ‘Codex Puteanus,’ another ‘ Codex Parisinus‚'
No. 5731, and another ‘Medic-eus? By this praiseworthy dili-
gence the reading in many passages has been corrected, and it is
not without sincere sorrow that we nevertlieless have felt our-
selves obliged to differ in opinion froin ΜΓ, Alschefski still more
frequently than from Bekker 3 but the truth is, that from hisover-

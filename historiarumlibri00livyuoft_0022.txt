tical career, or become a toacher of rhetoric. But we know nothing
ol' his devoting himself to either the one profession or the other.
He seems rather, being possessed of an easy independence, to have
remained in a private station, busied with liis own studies3 to have
married, and become the father osa family; and to have lived prin-
cipally at Rome, 011 ternis of intimacy with the most accomplished
rnen of that capital. He himself was a much-prized member oftho
small but brilliant circle that Augustus had drawn around hirn; and
it was his counscl which induced the emperor's grandson, Claudius
-who was afterwards emperor—to apply his attention to the writing
of historical works. Livy's first literary productioris were philo-
sophical treatis‘cS, which were highly valued. His ‘Dialogi’ also,
occupying u middle position between philosophy and history, were
held in much esteem. He earned immortality, however, by the
execution‘ol⁴ a great and comprehensive work on the history of the
Roman people‚ l'rorn the building of the city till the year 9 B.C., in
which year Claudius Drusus—the stepson of Augustus—after mak-
ing a successful campaign against the Germans, and penetrating
further into their country than any other Roman general had done,
died on his march back into Gaul. The period, therefore, at which
the history closed was one when the Roman eagles were still soaring
triumphantly, and when the state was entirely sree from intestine
coniniotions, the constitution being well balanced between mo-
narchical despotism and republican licentiousness. He might,
perhaps, have carried on his history further—for instance, till the
death of Augustus, A. D. 14 - but, besides other reasons to us
unknown, by which he may have been induced 10 close it earlier,
had he continued it to this point, he would then have had to describe a
113111 period, comprehending the failure of the plans formed by the
Romans for the subjugation of Germany, and many sad presages of
the coming reign ofdespotism at home. Whatever were his reasons,
it is certain that hc resolved to finish his work in 142 books,* with
the year 9 B. c., though he lived till the fourth year of the reign of
Tiberius ; when he died at Patavium, his native city, in the seventy-
sixth year of his age.

Livy did not enter on the composition of his colossal history till
he had reached the middle period of life, forthere is a passage in
the l9th chapter of book i. which plainly refers to the closing of the
temple of Janus by Augustus in 29 B.c., when Livy was thirty
years of age. We can, moreover, fix the writing of this book before
25 B. c.,because in that year the temple was again shut for a second
time 111 1113 reign ofAugustus; and yet Livy, in the passage already
mentioned, speaks of its having been closed only once after the
Aetian war. From the time when Livy commenced his history, he
no doubt laboured constantly at'its composition. It was probably
published in parts, as each book or decade was finished, and whilst
the work was proeeeding, the author’s fame gradually spread over
the world. An instance of Livy’s celebrity is mentioned by Pliny
(Epist. ii. 3), who tells us that a Spaniard travelled from Gades

 

* Niebuhr (Lectures on Rom. Hist.. vol. iii„ p. lviii.. w ed. Schmitz) expressos
it as his opinion that, as there is an cvidcnt want ofsynimetry in Livy‘s work
being comprohended in 142 books, the author probably intended to complete
fifteen decades¹ but died before he could aecoinplish his object.

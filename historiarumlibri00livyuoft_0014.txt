While several valuable and copious Latin Lexicons have within a few
years been published in this country, a want has long been felt and aeknow-
ledgeil of a good Scnoon DicTioNAiw, which within reasonable compass and
at a moderate price should present to the student all the insorination requisite
t'or his purposes, as elucidatecl by the most recent investigations, and at the
same time uniucumbered with eruditiori useful only to the advanced scholar,
and increasing the size and cost of the work beyond the reach of a large por-
tion of the coniinunity. It is with this view especially that the present work
has been prepared, and the names of its distinguished authors are a sufficient
guarantee that this intention has h cn skilfully and accurately carried out.

The present volume has been compiled by Dr. Kaltschmidt. the well-known
German Lexicographer, srom the best Latin Dictionaries now in use through-
out Europe. and has been carefully revised by Dr. Leonhard Schmitz. Learned
discussions and disquisitions could not be introduced, as incompatihle with
the objects for which the Dictionary is intended. and because they would have
swelled considerably the bulk of the volume. On the other hand, it has been
thought advisable to give, as sar as possible, the etymology os each word, not
only tracing it to its Latin or Greek root, but to roots or kindred forms of
words occurring in the cognate languages os the great Indo-Germanic family.
This feature, which distinguishes the present Dictionary from all others. can-
not fail to awaken the learner to the interesting fact ofthe radical identity os
many apparently heterogeneous languages, and prepare him at an early stage
sor the delightful study ofcomparative philology.

The aim ofthe publishers has been to carry out the author's views as far ae
possible by the form and arrangement of the volume. The type, though clear
and well printed, is small, and the size of the page such as to present an im-
mense amount of matter in the compass of a single handsome 181110. volume,
furnished at a price sar below what is usual with such works, and thus placing
within the reach of the poorest student a neat, convenient. and complete
[hencon' embodying the investigations of the most distinguished scholare os
t e age.

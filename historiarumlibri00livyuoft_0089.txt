¹ centuria is derived from centum, but frequently loses the sense
of the definite number. aud means then simply ‘ division) This is
the case here, sor the ‘centuries‘ in the various classes had by no
means the same number of men; sor instance, it is said in the course
of the chapter that the whole multitude who were possessed ol' less

tell us at what age rnen were considered seniores by Roman laW, hut
we know from other authors that the seniors in the classes of Servius
were men between sorry-five and sixty years of age, and that those
about sixty were not ranked in the centuries at all. The whole ar-
rangement described iu this chapter refers to the army muster, but
the voting in the comitia centuriata was also regulated by it.

without any regard to the census of each.

Tne object of this publication is to present a series of elementary works
suited to the wants of the beginner, as well 35 accurate texts of the more pro-
minent ancient writers, revised in accordance with the latest investiga-
tions and MSS„ and the most approved principles os modern criticism.—
These are accompanied with· notes and illustrations introduced srmrineg,
avoiding on the one hand the error os overburdening the work with commen-
tary. and on the other that of leaving the student entirely to his own resources.
The main object has been to awaken the scholar's mind to a sense of the beau-
ties and peculiarities of his author, to assist him where assistance is neces-
sary, aud to lead him to think and to investigate sor himself. For this pur-
pose maps and other engravings are given wherever usesul, and each author
is accompanied with a biographical and critical sketch. The form in which
the volumes are printed is neat and convenient, while it admits ostheir being
sold at prices unprecedentedly low, thus placing thern within the reach of many
to whom the cost of classica! works 1135 hitherto proved a bar to this depart-
ment of study. It will be seen, therefore, that the series combines the follow·
ing advantages:

1. A gradually ascending series os School Books on a uniform plan, so as to
constitute within a definite number, a complete Latin Curriculum.

2. Certain arrangements in the rudimentary volumes, which will insure a
sair amount of knowledge in Roman literature to those who are not designed
for professional life, and who therefore will not require to extend their studies
to the advanced portion of the series.

3. The text of each author will be such 35 1135 been constituted by the most
recent collatioris os manuscripts, and will be prefaced by biographical and cri-
tical sketches in English. that pupils may be made aware os the character and
peculial-hies of the work they are about to study.

4. To remove difficulties, and sustain an interest in the text, explanatory
notes in English will be placed at the foot of each page, and such comparisons
drawn as may serve to unite the history of the past with the realities of
modern times. .

5. The works¹ generally. will be embellished with maps and illustrative
engravings,-accompaniments which will greatly assist the student·s compre-
hension of the nature of the countries and leading circumstances described.

6. The respective volumes will be issued at a price considerably less than
that usually charge& and as the texts are from the most eminent sources, and
the whole series constructed upon a determinate plan, the practice of issuing
new aud altered editions, which is complained of alike by teacliers and pupils,
will be altogether avoided.

The series consists os the following volumes, which have recently appeared

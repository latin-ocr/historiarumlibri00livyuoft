enim, ut, cum populus regem jussisset, id sic ratum esset,
si Patres auctores¹ fierent. Hodieque² in legibus magistra-
tibusque rogandis usurpatur idem jus, vi adempta: prius-
quam populus suffragium ineat, in incertum comitiorum
eventum Patres auctores fiuiit.³ Tum interrex, contione
advocata, ‘Quod bonum, faustum felixque sit⁷⁴ inquit⁷
‘Quirites7 regom create: ita Patribus visum est. Patres
deinde, si <lignum qui secundus ab Romulo numeretur crea-
ritis, auctores fient.’ Adeo id gratum plebi suit, ut, ne victi
beneficio viderentur, id modo sciscerent juberentque, ut se-
natus decerneret, qui Romae regnaret.

18. Inclita justitia religioque ea tempestate Numae Pom-
pilii erat. Curibus Sabinis habitabat, consultissimus⁵ vir,
ut in illa quisquam esse aetate poterat, omnis divini atque
humani juris. Auctorem doctrinae ejus, quia non extat
alius, falso Samium Pythagoram edunt, quem Servio Tullio
regnante Romae, centum amplius post annos, in ultima
Italiae ora, circa Metapontum Heracleamque et Crotona,
juvenum aemulantium studia coetus habuisse⁶ constat. Ex

¹ Auctor is not only one who first mentions or produces anything‚
but also one who confirms and ratifies a thing, and thereby makes it
take effect. Compare ii. 56, note.

2 ⁴ And (still) at the present time! Many manuscripts read hodie
quoque, but a conjunction seems necessary for the connection.

³ This was an ordinance of the lez· Publilia, passed in the year 339
Β. eL (Livy, viii. 12, odfin). 'l‘har law took away a great portion of
the influence which the senate exercised over the dernoeratic ele-
ment of the constitution, the senate being made to give its formal
assent to the resolutioris of the comitia before they were passed.
Here was the usas, all vis being taken away.

⁴ A common formal introduction to a legal document or set speech,
similar to our ‘In the name of God, amen,’ or to another Latin
phrase in frequent use, quod bene vertat. In qnod bonum,faustum‚
διο. observe the tautology, ⁴ good. health (prosperum-bringing, and
fortunate.' Such pleonasms are frequent in legal formulae: another
occurs in the next sentence, sciscerent juberentque. The conjunction
in such cases is very often omitted. Compare Zumpt, ὖ 742, odfin.

⁵ Eqnivalent.to peritissimus, the usual expression juris (jure) con-
sullus being here made use of.

⁸ ‘ For-med clubs of the youths who emulated (followed, adopted)
his views.‘ The school of Pythagoras was distinguished by this
peculiarity, that his disciples adopted not only his philosophical ”
tenets, but also his political and moral principles, and were formed
into clubs, which exerted themselves to gain political influence in
the Greek states of Southern Italy, and thereby drew upon them—
selves political persecution. Livy justly discredits the statement of
some old annalists, that the renowned wisdom of Numa was derived
from Pythagoras. Its nature was not philosophical‚ but purely re·
lifgilqus and derived from constant intercourse with the wise priests
o ts nation.

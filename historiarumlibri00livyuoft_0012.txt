l am happy to say that 111 myjndzment the testimonials to the excellence of the series
that you have already received are t'u1ly desei-ved. ‘l'he cheapness and convenient form
ofthcse volnmes, and especially the character or the notes, make them precisely the kind
uf text hook which 1 should put into the hund os the young classical student. [shall re-
commend the students uf this college 111 procure your edition of such of the Latin authors
as we are accus-tomen to read. Yuu have my best wishes sor your success in your praise-
wort iy enterprise.

The accuracy of 1118 text, and the judmiousness os the notes, as well as the cheapness
ol* the volumus, render 11115 8111111111 ol the 81355185 111051 deserving of public attention.

From Phor. ,loun Wussemn, Ashury University, Greeucastle, Ia„ Dec.8‚ 1848.

As far as Ι have exanmied, l nm well pleased with them. The notes appear to he what
they ought, explanations of difficult passages. 31111 not extended translations, so common
and so detrimenta} to Classical attaininent. The modest remarks οἱ the editors on ‹hs-
puted passages :ire-worthy of notice aud imitatum. 111 111858 remarks, 1 refer principauy
to the edition of virgil, which 1 have exaiumed more than the others. and which 1 801151-
der far superior›to any other edition extant m our country. The cheapness of the senes
is a valuable consuleration; and the publishers deserve aud ‹souhtless will receive a har-
ἴεῗίοἰ thanks from many a student whose 1111811881 and desire of knowledge are superior

From A. CAMPBELL, President of Reman-y Collega, Va„ Νσυ. 22, 1848.

l have just glanced, with much 1118351118, over your edition of Virgil. being the second
volume of Schmitz and Znnnpt's Classical Series. ·

This is just the ¹thing 1 have long desired to see—a neat, handsome. correct. and cheap
edition of the Latin Classics, reheved from the extraneous aad unwieldy lore of prosing
doctors. The addenda or notes 111 1118 margin of this handsome volume are just such us
the student needs. The series wrll doubtless meet with very eneral favour srom 311
teachers 31111 learners, because of its clear, accurate, and beautiiu typography, its general
good taste, its cheapness, and its judicious adaptationi 1ο 1118 genius and wants of the age.

 

 

From Calates Wmffimm, Pres. of Rector Collega, Taylar Cy„ Va„ Dec. 1, 1848.

The 1183111855 aud beauty, and, as far as 1 have exannned, the correctness of execution,
together w1th the lucid arrangement of the notes. 1111151, Ι think, commend your edition·
to public pati-onage. I am delighted tosee Vzrffl'l, my favoni-ite poet, so handsomely exe-
81111ιίῗῆ 1 hxave recommended your 581185 10 our students, as l esteem them worthy of ι

881 8 pre erence.

 

From cuium-omen Monens, Esox Sup. Com. Schools. Albany, .Ν·. Κ, July 27, 1849.

The high character of the gentlemen who superintend the publication. for deep and
varied eruditiori, is 3 sufficient guarantee for the correctness of the text. The brief notes
are—suggestive, rather than translative, 3111] much better than the labored expositione
which carry the student along, instead of pointing out the way. The cheapness and con-
vetment sizei of the books, to say nothing of their literary merit, cannot fail to bring them
in o genera 1158. 6

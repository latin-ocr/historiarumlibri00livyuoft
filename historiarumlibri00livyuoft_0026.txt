’1 11818 are other v {iriations between the language of Livy and that
of Cicero, v. hich, however must be attributes to, and are indeed
proofs of, the progressive development of Latin syntax. We may
mention. as one of these, the use of the future participle active 111 a
hypothetical sense; for example (xxiii. 44) dedituris se Hannibali
non fnisse arcessendum Romanum praesidium—-that 18, ‘ if they had
been intending to give themselves up to Hannibalf &ie

Quintilian (i 9) tells us that Asinius Pollio, the celebrated orator,
historiari, and poet of the Augustan age, reproached Livy with
Patavinitas—that is, a provincial mode of expression in use at
Patavium, as distinguished from the standard style of the capital.
It is vain for us now to inquire in what this consisted; for though
we may be able to state the difference between the style of one
author and that of another, we are not in a position to recognise
slight dialectic varieties, perhaps merely of pronunciation. Besides,
Asinius Pollio, having rather too high an idea of his own abitinas,
was considerably addicted to speaking slightingly of other distin-
guished authors. Quintilian informs us (xii. 1. ᾗ 22) that he even
ventured to depreciate Cicero's style. The Patavinity‚ therefore,
tnay be nothing but a petty spiteful invention.

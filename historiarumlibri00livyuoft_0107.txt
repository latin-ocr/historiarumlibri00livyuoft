Etrusci tantum vates adhiberentur, hoc velut domestico

the Homine plain. thirty·eight miles from Rome, on the side of the
via Latina. now called Segni. and possessed of considerable monu-

the via Appia. about sixty miles srom Rome, and at the extreme
point of her even then tolerably extended dominion. Circeii is not

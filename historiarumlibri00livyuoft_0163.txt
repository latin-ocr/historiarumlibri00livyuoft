¹ ⁴ The Hernieians fell to him as his province :’ the first instance
of this expression. afterwards so common. in which rovincia (pro-
bably a contradiction for providentia) has the sense o ¹ a matter to
be attended to or looked aster! From this signification came that
of the foreign country in which this official activity was exercised.

² This is the same Sp. Cassius who was consul for the first time in
the year 502 1342. (see Livy, ii. 17), and for the second time in 493
(see chap. 33), when he concluded the treaty with the Latius. This,
therefore. was now his third consulship, and he was so fortunate in
it as to gain another body of allies—namely‚ the Hernici—to assist
the Romans against their common foes, the Aequi and Volsci. Livy
is to be blamed for the omission of the notices iter-um and tertium,
unless these have somehow slipped out of the manuscripts.

³ ‘ Intended to divide) The statement, however? may justly be
doubted, for (see chap. 22) the Hernici appear afterwards not as a
powerless nmion, but as equal allies of the Romans and Latins.
The error in this tradition was in all probability occasioned by the
circumstance, that in the treaty between the three tribes it was
stipulated that all the territory which their united armies might con-
quer. and all the booty which they might obtain. should be equally
divided; that is, a third should be given to each nation.

⁴ That is, ⁴ although it was public property, or the property ofthe
state! The imperfect adjiciebat used of an action attempted, but
not completed. See Gram. ᾗ 335, note 2.

⁵ This was the general name of any law or bill by which land be-
longing to the state (ager publicus) was handed over to privateindi-
viduats, being either divided amongst Roman citizens. or assigned
for the maintenance of a new colony. A proposal such as this al-
ways excited great commotioris. because land of this kind had before
been let out to occupants (possessores) either at arent, or free. These
therefore, naturally opposed a bill which would deprive them of the
use of whaat‘ had been legally made over to thern.

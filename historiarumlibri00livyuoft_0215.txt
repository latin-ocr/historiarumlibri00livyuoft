16. Sub idem fere tempus et legati, qui redierant ab
Carthagine, Romam rettulerunt omnia hostilia esse, et
Sagunti excidium nunciatum est3 tantusque simul maeror
patres misericordiaque sociorum peremptorum indigne¹ et
pudor non lati auxilii et ira in Carthaginienses metusque
de summa rerum² cepit, velut si jam ad portas hostis esset,
ut tot uno tempore motibus animi turbati trepidarent magis
quam corisuler-erit.³ Nam neque hostem acriorem belli-
cosioremque secum congressum, nec rem Romanam tam
desidem unquam fuisse atque imbellem.⁴ Sardos Corsosque
et Istros atque Illyrios lacessisse magis quam exercuisse
Romana arma, et cum Gallis tumultuatum verius quarn
belligeratum.⁵ Poenum hostem veteranum, trium et viginti
annorum⁶ militia durissima, inter Hispanas gentes semper
victorem, duci acerrimo assuetum, recentem ab excidio

¹ ‘ Pity sor the allies butchered in a revolting manner.’ Indigne
is astrong word, meaning much more than is given by the weak
translation, ⁴ in an unworthy manner.’ It expresses the violation of

the rights os humanity.
² Summa rerum, pretty much the same as respublica, ‘the highest

interests os the state‚⁷ ‘the public weal.’

³ ⁴ Their rninds wavered (were undecided) rather than deliberated
what was to be done.' As to trepidare. see chap. 14, p. 199, note 3.

⁴ To account sor the state of mind just described, Livy gives us
the thoughts ofthe Romans in the oratio obliqua, which is to be ex
plained by supplying some verb of thinking or declaring, such as
perhaps putabant or existimabant. See Grmn. <> 388. The reproach
which, according to Livy, the Romans raised against themselves,
that the state had become unwarlike, must rather be attributed to
the liveliness oftheir feelings than set down as a truth. The wars
with the Gauls at least had been both difficult and dangerous, and
had by no means permitted them to remain in unwarlike ease.

⁶ It was a peculiar usage of the Romans to call the wars with the
Gauls on the Po by the name of tumultus—not with the view of
lessening their importance but rather to indicate the suddenness of
the attacks made by these warlike tribes, and the constant state

’“ of watchsulness in which the Romans had to be. The islands of

Sardinia and Corsica were subdued aster small, but long-con—
tinued and obstinate wars. The Istri—inhabitants osa district bor·
dering on the·Veneti, where now are situated Trieste, Cape d'Istria,
Fiume, and Pola—were conquered in the year 221 B.e. The Illy-
rians—inhabitants ot'the east coast of the Adriatic. from Dyrrhac-
hium northwards. and of the numerous islands situated off this coast
—were conquered in the year 229 Bc, and compelled to give up
piracy. Livy would probably have mentioned here the wars carried
on at this time with the Liguriam, had not his object been to speak
slightingly of the Romans. ¹

⁶ Livy reckons the whole time between the first and second Punic
wars as a time of war for the Cathaginians, during which their sol·
diets had become veterane.

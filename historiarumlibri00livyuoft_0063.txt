Lunna 1. 49

24. Forte in duobus tum exercitibus erant trigemini
fratres, nec aetate nec viribus dispares. Horatios Curiatios-
que suisse satis coustat3 nec ferme res antiqua alia est
nobilior: tamen in re tam clara nominum error¹ manet,
utrius populi Horatii, utrius Curiatii suerint. Auctores
utroque trahunt ;2 plures tamen invenio, qui Romanos Hora-
tios vocent3 hos ut sequar, inclinat animus. Cum trige-
minis agunt reges, ut pro sua quisque patria dimicent ferro:
ibi imperium sore, unde³ victoria fuerit. Nihil recusatum
tempus et locus convenit. Priusquam dimicarent5 foedus
icturn inter Romanos et Albanos est his legibus, ut, cujusque*
populi cives eo certamine vicissent, is alteri populo curn bona
pace imperitaret. Foedera alia aliis legibu5‚ ceterum eodem
modo omnia fiunt.⁵ Tum ita factum accepimus, nec ullius
vetustior foederis memoria est. Fetialis regem Tullum ita
rogavit ‘Jubesne me, rex, cum patre patrato populi Albani
foedus ferire'3' Jubente rege, ‘sagmiiia,' inquit, (ιε, rex,
posc0.' Rex ait ‘Puram⁶ tollito) Fetialis ex arce graminis
herbam puram attulit. Postea regem ita rogavit ‘Rex‚ facisne
metu regium nuntium populi Romani Quiritium? vasa⁷ co-

 

¹ Error means here not ‘ a ntistake‚' but ‘an uncertainty.'

² We may translate this by ‘pull both ways,' since tlte phrase
seems to be taken from horses in a carriage punina different ways,
and thus drawing the vehicle sometimes to one side, sometimes tc
another. The meaning here is, that some authors make the Horatii
Romans, others Albans, and the same with the Curiatii. The ex·
pressiori utroque trahunt is concise: αἷιί alio trahunt would mean
nearly the same thing; not, however, implying, as the other does
that there were but two parties.

³ Properly ubi, but we may say ab hac parte victoria est or stat.

⁴ Properly cajuscunque‚· nay‚ we ought perhaps to correct the
reading se. Quandoque frequently occurs in Livy sor quandocunque,-
for example, i. 31, quandoque idem prodigium nuntiaretur. Compare
Zumpt, ᾗ 288, note.

⁵ This modus is described by Livy according to the most ancient
example. The observance of the formalities required at the con-
clusion of a treaty was committed in the Roman state to ilie charge
οξ a college of priests called Fetiales. At any transaction of this
kind the college delegated three of its members to attend, the chief
of whom was called pater patratus ; that is, the father charged with
the duty of completing (patrare) the business. A particular kind of
grass herbs (sagmina) from the Capitol was necessary at ilie sacri-
hce. These were called verbenae, or sacrificial herbs, the word
being probably derived from verber, verberare, because these herbs
were used at the slaughter of the victim. The rest of the formula
(carmen) is given by Livy. -

⁶ Supply herbam. The king gives orders to bring that which the
fetialis, well acquainted with the ceremony, had ready.

⁷ ¹ Furniture,’ everything belonging to them, which was by this

formalitg placed under the protection of the rights of ambassage.

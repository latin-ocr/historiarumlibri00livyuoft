mann xxi. 183

3. In Hasdrubalis locum¹ haud dubia res suit quin prae-
rogativam militarem, qua extemplo juvenis Hannibal in
praetorium delatus imperatorque ingenti omnium clamore
atque assensu appellatus erat, favor plebis sequeretur. Hunc
vixdum puberem Hasdrubal litteris ad se arcessierat3 ac-
taque res etiam in senatu suerat, Barcinis nitentibus ut
assuesceret militiae Hannibal atque in paternas succederet
opes. Ηειιιηο,ε alterius factionis princeps, ‘et aequum pos-
tulare videtur' inquit ‘Hasdruba13 et ego tamen non censeo,
quod petit, tribuendum) Cum admiratione tam ancipitis
sententiae in se omnes convertisset, ‘florem aetatis⁷ inquit
‘Hasdrubak quem ipse patri Hannibalis fruendum praebuit,
justo jure eum' a filio repeti censet: nos tamen minime
decet 'uventutem nostram pro militari rudimento⁴ assue-
facere ibidini praetorum. An hoc timemus, ne Hamilcaris
filius nimis sero imperia immodica et regni paterni speciem
videat, et cujus regis genero hereditarii sint relicti exercitus

to Livy. however, it was expressly stipulated in the treat that the
independence of Saguntum should be preserved intact. ἔω Poly-
bius denies this.

¹ This sentence is somewhat irregular. when the author began
with in Hasdrubalis locum, he no doubt purposed to go on thus—
Hanuibal primurn a militibus im emtor creatus, deinde et iam a populo
Carthaginiensi institutus esc. eaving. however. the construction
which he had begun, he passes over into haud dubia reasuit. quin
praerooativam militaremsavor plebis sequeretur, expres-sing the prin·
οἶμαι t ought—namely‚ Hannibal imperator creatus est—by a paren-
thesis added to praerogativam militarem. '1‘0 this parenthesis belong
properly the words in Hasdrubalis locum. Such irregularities. not
tn sense, but in construction. are to be found in almost all writers
both ancient and modern, and are to be ascribed to the so-called

rata negligentia, or rather, to speak more accurately. to the un-
ferced naturalness of expression. The ordinary reading is savor-
etiam plebis‚· but etiam is wanting in the best manuscripts, and is
not necessary.

² Livy gives us here a specimen of the quarrels in the senate of
Carthage, which is very interesting, as allowing us a peep at the
scurrilous personalities which the randees of that mighty city some·
times threw out against each ot er. The antithetical statement
that Hasdrubal asked what was just, and yet that his request should
not be granted, excited the wonder of the auditors, and thereby
made lt'he reproach contained in the subsequent explanation all the
more ittet. ’

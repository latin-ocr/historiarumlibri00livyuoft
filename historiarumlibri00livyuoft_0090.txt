eines tubicinesque, in tres centurias distributi. Undecim
milibus haec classis censebatur. Hoc minoi· census reliquam
multitudinem habuit: inde una centuria sacta est, immunis
militia. Ita pedestri exercitu ornato distributoque, equitum
ex prirnoribus civitatis duodecim scripsit centurias. Sex
item alias centurias, tribus ab Romulo institutis, sub iisdem,

uibus inauguratae erant2 nominibus fecit. Ad equos emen-

os dena milia aeris ex publico data3 et quibus equos
alerent, viduae attributae, quae bina milia aeris in annos
singulos penderent.¹ Haec omnia in dites a pauperibus in-
clinata onera: deinde est honos additus. Non enim, ut ab
Romulo traditum ceteri servaverant reges, viritim suffragium
eadem vi eodemque jure prorniscue omnibus datum est; sed
gradus sacti, ut neque exclusus quisquam suffragio videretur,
et vis omnis penes primores civitatis esset.2 Equites enim
vocabantur primi7 octoginta inde primae classis centuriae
primum peditum vocabantur:³ ibi si variaret, quod raro
incidebat, ut⁴ secundae classis vocarentur3 nec fere unquam
infra ita descenderent ut ad infimos pervenirent. Nec
mirari opertet hunc ordinem, qui nunc est, post expletas
quinque et triginta tribus, duplicato earum numero centuriis

number os centuries, according to Livy, 194, whereas Dionysius
reckons 193, having no accensi.

¹ The unmarried ladies had to furnish the knights with so much
money that each might receive :2000 ases annually to keep his horse.
Grammatically. we must connect viduae attributae, quibus (viduis)
equos alerent, the quibus, however, being not exactly ‘by means of
whom‚’ but ‘by means of whose fortune.’ The viduae, who are
here both widows and unmarried heiresses, did not pay each the same
sum, but made up among thern as much as gave 2000 ases to each
knight; so that the distributive bina refers not to the contributors,
but to the recipiente. Aeris is equivalent to assium, and we must
here understand the so-called heavy ases, grave aes, ten of which
made a denarius3 so that the sum given sor buying the horse
amounted to sorty gold pieces, and for its yearly maintenance to
eight, one gold piece (nummus aureus) being equal to twenty-five
den rii of silver money.

² ffhis was the case, because in the comitia centuriata each cen-
tury, whatever the number of men who composed it, had but one
suffragium, ‘ vote ;' so that a century os the rich, though very much
smaller than one of the poor, had an equal vote.

⁸ The last three words have been omitted in the modern editions,
contrary to the authority of the manuscripts. They are, however,
not faulty, but merely express more definitely that the centuries of
the first class were called first of the infantry.

⁴ Ut does not depend on any single word, but on the general
sense: ‘it was so arranged that.' Descenderent, a general expres·
sion, ‘they (Fr. on, Germ. man) should descend.’ The passive
· descenderetur, might have been used impersonally.

¹ From Livy's narrative we might be led to believe that the whole
nation ofthe Sabines ceased at this time to have an independent ex-
istence, and became Roman. Such, however, was not the case till
a much later period, when Rome had made herself the mistress of
a great part of Italy. All the truth that can be gathered from this
tradition is probably this, that at a very early period in Roman
history a strong body of Sabines was added to the original popula-
tion, which consisted principally of Latins. The Roman people
were called in legal language tairites; and if we admit that this
word is of Sabine origin, and derived either from the name of the
Sabine town Cures, or from the Sabine word quiris—⁸ a spear' or
¹ lance, -—we may naturally inser that the Sabines either formed the
principal element in the early populatiori of Rome, or were at least
the most warlike citizens.

² ‘ On firm ground‚’ ‘ground on which he could tread,' (in quo
vadere poterat). This place, says Livy, and not the marsh or hog
itself, was called lacus Curtius. The bog did not exist in Livy’s
time, but the name was still given to a part of the Forum.

³ Another explanation os ancient names, which, however, is not
admitted by other authors. Of the names of the thirty curiae, but
few are known to us: Titia. Faucia, Rapta (which may have been
the names of women); but Foriensis, Veliensis, and Tifata, appear
to be of topographical origin.

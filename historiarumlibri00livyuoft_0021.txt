INTRODUCTION.

the Roman historiari, was born,
according to Jerome's translation
of the ⁴ Chronicle of Eusebius‚'
in the second year os the lssoth
Olympiaci—that is, 59 13.c.‚ the
, same year in which the orator
Messalla Corvinus was born;
and died Olymp. 199‚1 —that is,
AJ). 17, in which year also the
poet Ovid died. Livy‘s native
city was Patavium (now Padua),
an ancient and considerable town
of the Veneti, situated in Upper
Italy, near the mouth of the river
Padus (Po). The Veneti had
been for a long time allies of the
Roman people, and were confirmed in their fidelity to them by their
common sear os the Gauls (in Gallia Cisalpina)v In reward for this
constancy they received, on the occasion of the Marcis or Social
war, the Roman franchise. The law by which this privilege was
conferred upon them was brought forward by the consul, Cn. Pom-
peius Strabo, father of Pompey the Great, and was consequently
called lex Pompeia. It may be remarked thatsthe Latin language
was then already in use among the Veneti, particularly in their
chief town, Patavium ; and afterwards acquired such an ascendancy,
that no information of the existence of a native Venetiam language
has come down to us. Livy was therefore born a Roman citizen,
and educated in Latin. It may be a doubtful question whether the
family of Livy had emigrated from Rome, where there was an
ancient plebeian gens of that name, often mentioned in history, or
whether a native Patavian family had assumed the Roman gentile
name of ‘ Liviusz' we believe the latter supposition to be the true
one, since it was very common for such peregrini (persons not
Roman citizensi as received the franchise to take the name of a
Roman genn and-we know nothing of the settlenicnt of a Roman
colony in the ancient territory of the Veneti.

Livy, as every allusion leads us to believe, was born of an eques-
trian family; that is. ofa family which belonged to the class holding
the middle station between the senators and the common people;
not possessing the prerogatives of the former, but distinguished
from the latter by opulence and free birth for three generations.
After finishing his studies in rhetoric and philosophy, he might

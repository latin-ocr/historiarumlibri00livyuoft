Ferentinae armati frequentes adessent. Qui ubi ad edictum
Romani regis ex omnibus populis convenere, ne ducem
suuni neve secretum¹ imperium propriave signa haberent,
miscuit manipnlos ex Latinis Romanisque, ut ex binis singulos
faceret binosque ex singulis. Ita geminatis manipulis centuri-
ones imposuit.

digna deum hominumque rege, quae Romano imperio, quae

³ The Volscians were a warlike nation, dwelling south osthe Prisci
Latini, in the mountainous district towards the source of the Liris,
in the townships of Sora, Arpinum, Atina, down on the sea-coast
in Anxur (Terracina), and in the Pomptine Plain (see i. 41, p. 73,

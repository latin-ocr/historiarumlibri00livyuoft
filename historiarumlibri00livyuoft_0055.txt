LIBER 1. 41

quibus locis, etsi ejusdem aetatis fuisset, qua fama in Sa-
b1n0s¹ aut quo linguae commercio quemquam ad cupiditatem
discendi excivisset? quove praesidio unus per tot gentes
dissonas sermone moribusque pervenisset? Suopte igitur
ingenio temperatum animum virtutibus fuisse opinor magis,
instructumque uon tam peregrinis artibus, quam disciplina
tetrica² ac tristi veterum Sabinorum, quo genere nullum
quondam incorruptius fuit. Audito nomine Numae Patres
Romani, quamquam inclinari opes ad Sabinos, rege inde
sumpto⁷ videbantur, tamen neque se quisquam nec factionis
suae alium nec denique Patrum aut civium quemquam prae-
ferre illi viro ausi, ad unum omnes Numae Pomp.lio regnum
deserendum decernunt. Aeetius, sicut Romulus augurato³
urbe condenda regnum adeptus θεῖ, de se quoque deos consuli
jussit. Inde ab augure, cui deinde honoris ergo publicum? id
perpetuumque sacerdotium fuit,⁴ deductus in arcem in lapide
ad meridiem versus consedit. Augur ad laevam ejus, capite
velato, sedem cepit, dextra manu baculum sine nodo adun-
cum tenens, quem lituum appellarunt. Inde ubi prospectu
in urbem agrumque capt0‚ deos precatus, regiones ab oriente
ad occasum determinavit, dextras ad meridiem partes, laevas
ad septentrionem esse dixit? signum contra, quo longissime

¹ ‘ By what fame rear: ing to the Sabinas? ,

² ‘ Gloomy.’ Tetricus is said by the ancients to be a Sabine word,
though it may perhaps be connected with the Latin adjective taeter.
Genus, in the following clause, is equivalent to gens, notio.

³ Au adverb, or rather an ablative absolute, derived from the par·
ticiple, and signifying ‘ after the auguries had been observed ;’ that
is, ‘ with the approval of the gods.’

⁴ Livy refers the opinion universally held by the Romans, that the
office of an augur was a public priesthood‚ and to be held sor life,
to this incident. The cause of his doing so is to be found in that
natural propensity which we have to attribute all old political ar-
rangements to some particular occasion and individual. The cere-
mony‚ described as having been gone through by the augur in this
case. was the common one in after-days. Honoris ergo, equivalent
to honoris causa. Ergo, in this sense, is ordinarily us'ed only in legal
formulae; sor examme, miles virtutis ergo donatus.

⁵ The augur—as we are expressly told by Dionysius. of Halicar-
nassus, who was a contemporary of Livy, and wrote in Greek a
history of Rome from the earliest times up to the Punic wars-had
his face turned to the east. It is therefore quite plain how, when
he drew the line on the heavens over his head srom east to west, the
south side of the sky was on his right, aud the north on his lest.
The left side was with the Romans the luckyone, and therefore
sinistrum, as an augural term, was equivalent tosaustnm. ,On this
account the Latin etymologists derived sinister from the verb sinere,
because an omen on the left hand ‘ permitted' (sineret) something to
be done. 4 :t

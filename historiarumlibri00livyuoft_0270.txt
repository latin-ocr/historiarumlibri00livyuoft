256 T. Livii.

aut nihil sensere obstrepente pluvia, aut quia jam moveri
nequibant prae lassitudine ac vulneribus, sentire sese dissi-
mularunt3 quietisque Poenis tacito agmine ab Scipione
consule exercitus Placentiam est perductus, inde Pado tra-
jectus¹ Cremonam, ne duorum exercituum hibernis una
colonia premeretur.

57. Romam tantus terror ex hac clade perlatus est, ut
jam ad urbem Romanam² crederent infestis signis hostem
venturum, nec quicquam spei aut anxilii esse, quo portis
moenibusque³ vim arcerent. Uno consule ad Ticinum victo,
altero ex Sicilia revocato, duobus consulibus, duobus con-
sularibus exercitibus victis, quos alios duces, quas alias
legiones esse quae arcessantur'3‘¹ Ita territis Sempronius
consul advenit, ingenti periculo· per effusos passim⁵ ad
praedandum hostium equites, audacia magis quam consilio
aut spe fallendi resistendive, si non falleret, transgressus.
Id quod unum maxime in praesentia desiderabatur,⁶ comitiis
consularibus habitis in hiberna rediit. Creati consules
Cn. Servilius et C. Flaminius.⁷

and consisting of those who had ssed to the camp, and of those who
had been leit behind when Sempronius marehed out. All these
crossed the Trebia during the night, and marched past the Car-
thaginian camp to Placentia by the same way which the 10‚ooo,
who had made their way out os the battle, had taken. The reason
of their not preferring the route towards the same point along the
Roman side of the Trebia, on which their own camp stood, is pro-
bably to be found in the difficulties os the ground.

¹ Exercitus Pado trajicitur is the sanie as exercitus Padum trajicit,
and wc might here have had Pado trajecto. See Gram. ὑ 251, with
note.

²We have inserted Romanam, following the best manuscripts.
The adjective seems to be necessary, lest perhaps Placentia or
Cremona might be understood.

³ Arcere with the ablative. See Gram. ὗ 297.

“The lamentation and anxiety seem rather exaggerated. The
separate mention of the events which occurred to the two consular
armies has also a rhetorical look. ⁴ Rome cannot have been in want
of generals, and the conscription of new legions had not yet become
so difficult a matter.

⁶ Passim means t everywhere, in all quartem, but separately, in
separate places.'

⁶This clause refers to the following comitiis habitis. As to id
quod for quod, see Gram. ᾧ 232, 2.

⁷ The latter for the second time (iterum), for he had been consul
in the year 223 B.c. He belonged to the popular party, was bold,
and in his former consulship had fought very suceessfully against
the Insubrian Gauls on the Po. It was probably the remembrance

‘t'ti this ειᾷῗςίθεε that principally occasioned his present election for

quently unintelligible. We have, according to our best judgment,
kept a middle course between over-innovation and over-adhe-
rence to present readings· and confidently believe that the text
now presented is very much more accurate than that in common
use.

Our notes are intended to explain the difficulties of the lan-
guage, which present themselves not only to the beginner, but
also to the more advanced student3 and by the illustration of allu-
sions to ancient customs, and the occasional collation of the state-
ments os other historians, to elucidate the exact meaning and con-
nection. In the first two books it was frequently necessary to
enter into a criticisrn upon the traditional nature os the early his-
tory of Rome3 and in doing this, we have endeavoured, on the
one hand, to treat with due regard the ingenious and poetical le-
gends with which that history abounds3 and on the other, to ex-
tract srorn them germs of truth, and state the real origin of the
Roman state, and of its wondrous development.

With regard to orthography, wc refer to our Grammar, where
we have stated the results found by a careful comparison of the
forms and rules given by the ancient grammarians with the
practice in the most trustworthy manuscripts. When a reference
is made merely to Gram.‚ Dr. Schmitz's Latin Grammar, prepared
for the present series, is the one alluded to.

Livy's whole work consisted of one hundred and sorty-two
books, divided-whether by the author himself or his tran-
scribers we know not—into decades, or sections os ten books each.
The great size of the work rendered complete copies os it very
rare, and consequently very dear, in the later ages of antiquity3
and to this circumstance we may chiefly attribute the disappear-
ance of such copies. No single manuscript of Livy in existence
contains even all those. books which we possess. The first hals
of the fifth decade (books xli.——xlv.) is found only in one manu-
script, which was discovered in the Benedictine Monastery at
Lorsch near Worms (⁸ Codex Laurishamensis’), and is now de-
posited in the Imperial Library at Vienna. The fourth decade,
too—a manuscript of Mainz being lost—is found, the greater
part os it at least (books xxxi.-—-xxxviii.)7 only in a Barnberg
manuscript. Of the first two existing decades (books i.——x. and
xxi—xxx.) there is a considerable number os manuscripts, few
of them, however, old and good. The best manuscripts of the
first decade are one at Florence (ί Codex Mediceus')‚ one at Paris
(No. 5725), and one at Oxsord (‘C0dex Harleianus'). The text
ofthe third decade depends principally upon the Paris manuscript,
which belonged to the learned Du Puy, and was hence called
‘ Codex Puteanus 3' upon the ‘Codex colbertinus,⁷ No. 5731 of

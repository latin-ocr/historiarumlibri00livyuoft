dicitur habuisse ad conciliandos plebis animos compositam:
cum¹ se non rem novam petere, quippe qui non primus,
quod quisquam indignari mirarive posset, sed tertius Romae
peregrinus regnum affectet: et Tatium non ex peregrino
solum sed etiam ex hoste regem sactum3 et Numam igna-
rum urbis, non petentem in regnum ultro accitum. Se, ex
quo sui potens suerit‚² Romam cum conjuge ac fortunis
omnibus commigrasse3 majorem partem aetatis epae, qua
civilibus officiis fungantur homines, Romae se quam in
vetere patria vixisse. Domi militiaeque sub haud poenitendo
magistro? ipso Anco rege, Romana se jura, Romanos ritus
didicisse. Obsequio et observantia in regem cum omnibus

on the other, that he was a Roman in everything but birth? Livy,
however, from ther length os the intervening sentence, sorgets that
he has begun with cum,- and therefore, instead of going on with tum, ,
he adopts a different mode os connection. The accusatives with the
infinitive contain the substance os the speech delivered by Tarqui-

raised himself by his own merits to be king of Rome. It seems pro-
bable, however, judging from many scattered traces, that he came
to Rome at the head of a great band of Etruscam, and thus ob-
tained power in the city3 and that with him there began a period in
the regal government at Rome of greater external prosperity and
splendour‚ but of internal discomsort and commotion.

Lmen 11. 119

inde mole Sabini bellum parabant. Adversus eos, et ne
quid simul ab Tusculo, unde etsi non apertum, suspectum
tamen bellum erat, repentini, periculi oreretur, Ρ. Valerius
quartum, T. Lucretius iterum consules faeti. Seditio inter
belli pacisque auctores orta in Sabinis aliquantum inde
virium transtulit ad Romanos. Namque Attius Clausus,
cui postea Appio Claudio fuit Romae nomen, cum pacis
ipse auctor a turbatoribus belli premeretur nec par factioni
esset, ab Regillo,¹ magna clientium comitatus maun, Romam
transfugit. His civitas data agerque trans Anienem: vetus
Claudia tribus,² additis postea novis tribulibus, qui ex eo
venirent agro, appellata. Appius inter Patres lectus haud
ita multo post in principum dignationem pervenit. Con-
sules infesto exercitu in agrum Sabinum profecti, cum ita
vastatione, dein proelio affixissent opes hostium, ut diu
nihil inde rebellionis timere possent, triumphantes Romam
redierunt. P. Valerius, omnium consensu princeps belli

¹ Regillum or Regilli, a township in the country of the Sabines,
different from the lacus Regillus mentioned in ehap. 19; the latter
is in the territory of Tusculum.

¹² There was in later times also a nova Claudia tribus, which like-
wise consisted of Sabines. The territory beyond the Anio, which
is here said to have been given to the new Roman citizens, belonged
to them in all probability before, for they were very near the bound-
ary between Latium and the ager Sabinus.

³ So the manuscripts ; understand sumptus. The editions read
elatus, ‘ he c{vas buried.’ Either reading is good, so far as the sense
is concerne .

⁴ In i. 53 it is mentioned that Suessa Pometia was taken from the
Volscians. From the present passage, it appears that at that time
a colony of Latins (probably mixed with Romans) had been settled
in the town as a garrison. The same seems to have been the case
with Cora, a city on the east of the Pomptine Plain, which has not
been mentioned before. As those here named Aurunci are called
elsewhere Volscians, we may assume that the author, whom Livy
followed in this part of the history considered both tribes as belong-
ing to the same race. The Aurunci, specially so called, recognised,
in late-r times at least, the city of Suessa Aurunca, the modern
Sessa, in the kingdom of Naples, as their capital; and this town
lies far to the south of Pometia, and is separated from it by the ter-
mortes of various cities and different tribes.

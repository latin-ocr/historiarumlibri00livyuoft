mors Hamilcaris peropportuna et ueritia Hannibalis dis-
tulerunt bellum. Medius Hasdruba inter patrem ac filium
octo ferme annos imperium obtinuit, flore aetatis, uti serunt,
primo Hamilcari conciliatus,¹ gener inde ob altam indolem
provecto annis ascitus, et quia gener erat, factionis Barcinae
opibus, quae apud milites plebemque plus quam modicae
erant, haud sane voluntate principum, in imperio positus.²
Is plura consilio quam vi gerens, hospitiis magis regulorum³
conciliandisque per amicitiam principum novis gentibus
quam bello aut armis rem Carthaginiensem auxit. Ceterum
nihilo ei pax tutior fuit: barbarus eum quidam palam, ob
iram interfecti ab eo domini‚⁴ obtruncavit; comprehen-
susque ab circumstantibus haud alio quam si evasisset vultu,
tormentis quoque cum laceraretur, eo fuit habitu oris ut
*lucrante laetitia dolores ridentis etiam speciem praebuerit!
Cu'm hoc Hasdrubale, quia mirae artis in sollicitandis gen-
tibus imperioque suo jungendis fuerat, foedus renovaverat
populus Romanus, ut finis utriusque imperii esset amnis

libertas servaretur.

able to the great Hamilcar.

² ‘ Promoted to the supreme command.' Hamilcar was surnamed
Barca, which was either a personal appellation, meaning ‘light
ning‚' or a generic name, indicating that he was a member of the
Carthaginian gens Barcina. which is mentioned by Ltvyin xxiii. 41.
From Barca Hie party in Carthage which supported Hamilcar. and
after him his son Hannibal. was called thesin-tio Barcina. The party
was opposed in the senate by another. less hostile to the Romans,
and the heads ot' which are here called principes. Against their
will Hasdrubal obtained the chief command in Spain; and in the
same manner the-factio Barcina maintained its influence during the
remainder of the war.

³ This was the name given to the princes of the Spanish tribes,
and of petty tribes in general3 whilst rex was reserved for greater
states, and was in later times bestowed by the Roman senate as an
honour on allied—that is, subordinate—princes.

⁶ Saguntum, the modern Murviedro (muri veteres), near Valencia,
was situated not far from the sea, and beyond* the Iberus (that is,

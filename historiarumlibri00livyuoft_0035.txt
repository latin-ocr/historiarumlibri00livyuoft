mnan 1. 21

manus¹ tradidit. Is sepultus in eo colle, qui nunc pars Ro-
manae est urbis, cognomen colli fecit. Proca deinde regnat:
is Numitorem atque Amulium procreat, Numitori, qui stirpis
maximus erat, regnum vetustum Silviae gentis legat. Plus
tamen vis potuit quam voluntas patris aut verecundia aetatis.²
Pulso fratre Amulius regnat. Addit sceleri scelus: stirpem
fratris virilem interimitJ fratris tiliae Reae Silviae per speciem
honoris, cum Vestalem eam legisset, perpetua virginitate spem
partus adimit.³

4. Sed debebatur‚4 ut opinor, satis tantae origo urbis maxi-
mique secundum deorum opes imperii principium. Vi com-
pressa Vestalis cum geminum partum edidisset, seu ita rata,
seu quia deus auctor culpae honestior erat,⁵ Martem incertae
stirpis patrem nuncupat. Sed nec dii nec homines aut ipsam
aut stirpem a crudelitate regia vindicant: sacerdos vinc-ta in
custodiam datur3 pueros in profluentem aquam mitti jubet.
Forte quadam divinitus’ super ripas Tiberis effusus lenibus
stagnis nec adiri usquam ad justi cursum poterat amnis, et
posse quamvis languida mergi aqua infantes spem serentibus
dabat. Ita velut defuncti regis imperiO, in proxima alluvie,

seem to have been invented by the annalists, or collected from old
legends, in order to supply the place of authentic information. The.
derivation ofthe name Tiberis from Tiberinus is equally unworthy
of credit, for ordinary etymology would lead us to suppose that the
name of the river (with which is connected the name of the town
Tibur) originated the name of the man, rather than vice τενεᾶ.

¹ A phrase expressing immediate succession. It is equivalent to
the Greek διάδοχον εἶχευ; that is, ‘ he had an immediate successor.

² ‘ Respect for (greater) age.⁷

8This allusion is explained hythe description given in i. 20 of
the office and rules of the vestal virgins. This institution was ex-
tremely old at Alba, and was introduced into Rome by the good
king Numa Pompilius.

⁴ Debeo alicui, ¹ Ι owe to some one,' or ‘I have to thank some one
for something.’ The passive is here used, because the subject
which feels the gratitude is very indefinite3 thus we may translate
debebatur by ‘the world, or mankind, had to thank.’ ,The imper-
fect refers us to the time when Rome was building, or when the
Fates were bringing about the train of events which resulied in its
being built. The gratitudo is conceived as having been felt then.

⁵Livy supposes either that the vesta] was herself deceived, or
that she ‘told an intentional falsehood. He has evidently no belief

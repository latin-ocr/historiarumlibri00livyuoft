IN parte operis mei licet mihi praefari quod in principio
summae totius¹ professi plerique sunt rerum scriptores,
bellurn maxime omnium memorabile, quae unquam gesta
sint, me scripturum, quod Hannibale duce Carthaginienses
cum populo Romano gessere. Nam neque validiores opibus
ullae inter se civitates gentesque contulerunt arnia,·neque
his ipsis tantum unquam virium aut roboris fuit :² et haud
ignotas belli artes inter se,³ sed expertas primo Punico
conserebant bello: et adeo varia belli fortuna ancepsque

Mars fuit, ut propius periculum⁴ suerint qui vicerunt.
Odiis etiam prope majoribus certarunt quam viribus,

¹ Summae totius, ‘of a whole connected work.’ Summa means
⁸ a whole‚’ in opposition to its parts. Livy says, then, that having
now come to a distinct part of his work—to wit, the history of §he
second Punic war—he may make the same remark which many
other historians have made at the beginning of their works—namely‚
thm they were about to describe very remarkable events. Thucy-
dides, for example. commences his history ofthe Peloponnesian war
with a similar observation. The whole history of a nation‚ such as
Livy narrates, must contain portions of very various importance.
The second Punic war, which broke out in 218 au.. stands out in
Roman history as of prime importance: it was a kind of ordeal os
the Roman state3 and when Rome came out os it, not unscatbed‚
indeed, but still strong and proud‚ no nation afterwards could ever
copiivgiyt {garg-{ihm at no time had C arthage and Rome been so power-
ful as when they henan the second Punic war3 and this statement
is quite correct. for {arthage had made up for the loss of Sicily and
Sardinia. which followed the first Punic war, by the appropriation
of Spain ; and all Roman writers unite in testifyingthat Italy, which
was closely connected with Rome, was never more populous, or.
from the military spirit and skill of its free-born inhabitants. more
flourishing. than shortly before the outbreak of the Hannibalian
war. Its wealth and population were great also in later times; but
the wealth was in the hands osa comparatively small number, while
the population in the Roman part was cotnposed principally of slaves.

mi e-c ass.

³ ‘ With each other,’ a more particular definition added to haud
ignotas.- the manner and peculiarities of the warsare of each were
known by experience to the other—were mutually known.

⁴ Livy uses both constructions—the dative and the accusative-

with21he comparative and superlative of prope. See Gram. ὖ 255,

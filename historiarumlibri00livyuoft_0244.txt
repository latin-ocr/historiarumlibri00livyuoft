Ea vero via insuperabilis suit. Nam cum super veterem
nivem intactam¹ nova modicae altitudinis esset, molli nec
praealtae² facile pedes ingredientium insistebant. Ut vero
tot hominum jumentorumque incessu dilapsa est, per nudam
infra glaciem fluentemque tabem³ liquescentis nivis ingre-
diebantur. Taetra ibi luctatio erat ut a lubrica glacie, non
recipiente vestigium et in prono citius pedes fallente‚⁴ ut,
seu manibus in assurgendo seu genu se adjuvissent, ipsis
adminiculis prolapsis iterum corruerent :⁵ nec stirpes circa
radicesve‚ ad quas pede aut manu quisquam eniti posset,
erant: ita in levi tantum glacie tabidaque nive voluta-
bantur. Jumenta secabant interdum etiam tum infimam
ingredientia nivem, et prolapsa jactandis gravius in conni-
tendo ungulis penitus perfringebant‚ ut pleraque velut pedica.

way, too, was shown to be persectly impassable; and at last he
came to the resolution of making a road down the rock in one way
or another. Now, after this sentence, the author goes on to show
the impossibility of going through the valleys at the sides os the
mountain.

¹ ‘ Over the old snow, which-had been lying untouched.’

² Scil. nivi, which is added in some editions, but is wanting in the
manuscripts, and can easily be supplied.

³ Tabes here is a sort of undecided substance, half snow, half
water, which came srom snow melted under the soldiers' feet. The
word is commonly used of the dissolution of compound bodies,
particularly of putrefaction. We must translate here ‘through the
water from the melting snow, which was flowing down.⁸

⁴ ‘ There was a feartul struggle, as was natural, on account of the
slippery ice, which did not permit the soot to be placed upon it,
and from the steepness, made the feet slip more easily. As to ab
said of the cause. ‘on account of, in consequence of‚’ see Gram.
<> 291, note 1. Fullo means, ‘ I cause to fall!

⁵ ‘ So that, whether they aided themselves in rising with their
hands or their knees, these, their very supporta, slipped, and they
again fell.’ This is the manuscript reading, and quite good. The
agminiclula are the hands and knees, by which they try to raise
t emse ves.

⁶ ⁴ The beasts of burden sometimes split parts of the ice, when
they went into it; and broke it completely, when, after falling,
they struck about with their hoofs more violently in trying to rise;
so that most of them, as if caught in a trap, stuck in the hardened
and deep thick ice.’

² Hannibal, then, after attempting in vain to go round the moun·
tam, prepared now to make a road down the precipice. For this,
purpose the frozen ground had to be sostened, which, according to
our author, he effeeted by means of fire and a large quantity of

vinegar.

20. Tum sacerdotibus creandis animum adjecit, quam·
quam ipse plurima sacra obibat, ea maxime, quae nnnc ad
Dialem flaminem' pertinent. Sed quia in civitate bellicosa
plures Romuli quam Numae similes reges putabat sore,
iturosque ipsos ad bella, ne sacra regiae vicis² desererentur,
flaminem Jovi assiduum sacerdotem creavit, insignique eum
veste et curuli regia sella³ adornavit. Hui-c duos flamines
adjecit, Marti unum, alterum Quirino. Virginesquc Vestae
legit, Alba oriundum sacerdotium et genti conditoris⁴ haud
alienum. His, ut assiduae templi antistites essent, stipen-
dium de publico statuit, virginitate aliisque caerimoniis
venerabiles ac sanctas fecit. Salios item duodecim Marti
Gradivo legit, tunicaeque pictae insigne dedit, et super tuni-
cam aeneum pectori tegnmen3 coelestiaque arma,⁵ quae
ancilia appellantur, ferre, ac per urbem ire canentes carmina
cum tripudiis⁶ sollemnique saltatu jussit. Pontificem deinde
Numam Marciums' Marci filium, ex Patribus Jegit‚ eique
sacra omnia exscripta exsignataque attribuit, quibus hostiis,
quibus diebus, ad quae templa sacra fierent, atque unde in
eos sumptus pecunia erogaretur.8 Cetera quoque omnia pub-

ogebotur, could be held only on dies fasti. As no learned Roman
could give any valid reason why a great many days were marked in
the calendar as nefasti, or could state their origin, their institution
was, as a matter of course, attributed to Numa.

He was obliged to remain constantly at Rome (to be assiduus).
Flumen was the name given to the peculiar priest of a divinity in
early times. whilst sacerdos is applied generally to any one invested
with a priestly office; for example, to an augur or a pontifex.
Sacerdos is also the proper designation of the peculiar priest. of any
of the more modern gods3 that is, of one not deifiedjn the early or
ante-historic times. γ

munerls.

³ Sella curulis. ‘ chair of office,' or ⁴ of state,’ probably srom cura.
The higlier magistrates had the privilege of sitting upon a finely-
adorned chair whilst hearing and deciding causes.

⁴ The gens of Romulus was that ofthe Silvii, and Rea Silvia, his
mother, had been a vestal.

⁵ Arma means here ‘shields,' and indeed generally the word has
principal reference to them. One ofthese ancilia was said to have
fallen from heaven, and was regarded as a pledge of divine assist-
ance. In order to prevent its being stolen, eleven others were made
exactly like it, to which os course no virtue was attached. So say
Dionysius. and Plutarch in his life of Numa.

‘⁵ Tripudium means ⁴ a stamping tread with the seet‚’ and is
derived from terram pavire.

⁷ Son-in-law of King Numa, and father of Ancus ,Mar-cius, the

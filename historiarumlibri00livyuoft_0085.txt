LIBER 1. 71

quaereretur gener Tarquinio, quisquam Romanae juventutis
ulla arte conferri potuit, filiamque ei suam rex despondit.
Hic quacunque de causa tantus illi honos habitus credere
prohibet, serva natum eum parvumque ipsum servisse.
Eorum magis sententiae sum, qui Corniculo capto Ser. Tullii,
qui princeps in illa urbe suerat, gravidam viro occiso uxorem,
cum inter reliquas captivas cognita esset, ob unicam' nobili·
tatem ab regina Romana prohibitam serunt serviti0² partum
Romae edidisse, Prisci Tarquinii dom0.³ Inde tanto beneficio
et inter mulieres familiaritatem anetam, et puerum, ut in
domo a parvo eductum, in caritate atque honore fuisse3 sor-
tunamvmatris, quod capta patria in hostium manus venerit,
ut serva natus crederetur secisse.⁴

40. Duodequadragesimo ferme anno, ex quo regnare coe-
perat Tarquinius, non apud regem modo sed apud Patres
plebemque longe maximo honore Ser. Tullius erat. Tum
Anci filii duo, etsi antea semper pro indignissimo habuerant,
se patrio regno tutoris fraude pulsos, regnare Romae ad-
venam non modo⁵ vicinae sed ne Italicae quidem stirpis,

high rank! Cultus is the whole outward conduct or mode of life,
particularly with regard to dress and domestic arrangements. for-
tunae is here a subjective, not an objective genitive. the sense being,
‘ the conduct which high rank requires,' not ⁴ the cultivation or

eager secking after high rank.⁷

¹ ‘ Distinguished.’ See i. 21, p. 45, note 4.

² ‘ Kept free srom slavery,’ sor prohibere is used with the accusa-
tive of the person as well as that os the thing; in the passive, there·
sore, we can say either prohibeor servitute, which is the construction
here. or servitus prohibetur α me.

³ Regularly iu domo.
⁴ The popular beliefthat Servius Tullius had been raised by for-

tune from the position osa slave to that of a king, kept its ground,
notwithstanding all the improvements and ernbcllishments which
were attempted on the tradition. It appears. however, more pro
habre, according to information which we have from Etruscan sources,
that Servius emigrated to Rome from Etruria at the head of a large
band of fugitives. We derive this information-which, as we have
mentioned, came ori inally, no doubt, from an Etruscan source—
from a speech of the {imperor Claudius, still preserved οη a tablet
at Lyons. This speech is a sull copy of that of which Tacitus
(Annal. xi. 24) has a digest, and is therefore given in the Comment-
ary to all the larger modern editions of that author.

⁵ The use osnon modo for non modo nou is quite common in Latin.
For vicinae other editions, following bad manuscripts. read civicae.
which is quite inadmissible, because if Tarquin had been bom a
citizen, the sons of Ancus would have had no reason to complain.
We must also remark that Livy never uses the adjective civicus

for civilis.

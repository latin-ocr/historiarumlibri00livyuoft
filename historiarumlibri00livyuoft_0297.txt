Lmen xxii. 283

vulgus pro cunctatore segnem, pro cauto timidum, affingens
vicina virtutibus vitia, compellabat3 premendoque superio-

rem, quae pessima ars nimis prosperis multorum successibus¹
crevit, sese extollebat.

13. Hannibal ex Hirpinis² in Samnium transit, Beneven-
tanum depopulatur agrum, Telesiam urbem capit: irritat
etiam de industria ducem, si forte accensum tot indignitati-
bus cladibusque sociorum detrahere ad aequum certamen³
possit. Inter multitudinem sociorum Italici generis, qui ad
Trasimenum capti ab Hannibale dimissique fuerant, tres
Campani equites erant, multis jam tum illecti donis promis-
sisque Hannibalis ad conciliandos popularium animos. Hi
nunciantes, si in Campaniam exercitum admovisset, Capuae
potiendae copiam sore, cum res major quam auctores esset,
dubium Hannibalem alternisque fidentem ac diffidentem
tamen, ut Campanos ex Samnio peteret, moverunt. Monitos

etiam atque etiam promissa rebus affirmarent‚⁴ jussosque

cum pluribus et aliquibus principum redire ad se dimisit.
Ipse imperat duci ut se in agrum Casinatem ducat, edoctus
a. peritis regionum, si eum saltum occupasset, exitum Ro-
mano ad opem ferendam sociis interclusurum.⁵ Sed Puni-
cum abhorrens os ab Latinorum nominum prolatione pro
Casino Casilinum dux ut acciperet fecit5 aversusque ab suo

¹ ‘By too favourable results with many;' that is, by being too
successful with many.

² Hannibal had been in Apulia. He must therefore have advanced
nearer Rome by passing into the next district—that of the Hirpini.
These were a Samnite racc, settled south of the Caudini and Pen-
tri. One of their towns was Abellinum, which still exists under
the same name; and in xxiii. 1, Compsa is mentioned as belonging
to them.

³ That is, to battle in the plain.
- ⁴ ‘After they had been again and again exhorted to prove the
truth of their promises by deeds.' We have struck out ut after
monitos, because etiam atque etiam belongs to the verb monere,
which again is often followed by the subjunctive without ut.

⁵ Casinum, a Roman colony, was so situated‚ that any one wh'o
had possession of the road there could cut off all communication
between the mountainous district and the plain country on the sea-
coast. The modern name is St. Germano; that is to say. at the
foot of the hill Monte Casino, on which stood the ancient city,
there is now a town of that name. In the following sentence we
have adopted the emendation of Drakenborch, the words os and
prolatione being wanting in the manuscripts; other attempts to
restore the correct sense are not satisfactory. The confounding of
Casinum and Casilinum is probably to be explained by the suppo-
sition that Hannibal pronounced the s in Casinum thick, like a
Phoenician shin (sh).

mima 1. 27

tum maxime lictoribus duodecim sumptis fecit. Alii ab
numero avium, quae augurio regnum portenderant, eum
secutum numerum putant. Me haud poeniten eorum sen-
tentiae esse, quibus et apparitores et hoc genus ab Etruscis
finitimis⁷ uude sella curulis, unde toga praetexta sumpta est,
numerum qnoque ipsum ductum placet; et ita habuisse
Etruscos, quod ex duodecim populis communiter creato rege
singulos singuli populi lictores dederint. Crescebat interim
urbs munitionibus alia atque alia appetendo loca⁷ cum in
spem magis suturae multitudinis, quam ad id, quod tum
hominum erat, munirent. Deinde ne vana urbis magni-
tudo esset, adjiciendae multitudinis causa, vetere consilio
condentium urbes, qui obscuram atque humilem conciendo
ad se multitudinem natam e terra sibi prolem ementie-
bantur,2 locum qui nunc septus descendentibus inter duos
lucos est,³ asylum aperit. Eo ex finitimis populis turba
omnis siue discrimine, liber an servus esset, avida novarum
rerum perfugit3 idque primum ad coeptam magnitudinem
roboris⁴ fuit. Cum jam virium haud poeniteret, consilium
deinde viribus parat. Centum creat senatores, sive quia is
numerus satis erat, sive quia soli centum erant, qui creari
Patres possent. Patres certe ab honore, Patriciique pro-
genies eorum appellati.⁵

¹ ⁴ I decidedly coincide in opinion with those who‚' διο. Me poe-
nitet not only means ‘I repent‚' but may also be used generally of
the feeling of disappointment, of discontent3 von (haud) me poenitet,
‘ I am content.’ The opinion that the apparitores, and particularly
that class of them called lictores, along with the rest ofthe insignia
of power, were derived from the Etruscans‚ is supported by other
Roman historians, as well as by Livy. Some of them think that
there were no apparitores till the time of the Tarquins.

² ‘ Who fableds Deucalion and Cadmus are instances.

³ ‘ A place which is now enclosed, and will be found by those who
come down from the arx (the north-eastern peak of the Capitoline
Hill) between the two groves.' The place was in the time of Livy
not an asylum, but, being looked upon as a sacred spot, was care-
fully enclosed. The right of sanctuary was not recognised at Rome,
as it was in the Greek states. The whole story ot* the asylum of
Romulus probably arose from the fact, that Rome was looked upon
as the home os all unfortunates‚ since there the peculiar regulation
was in force that slaves, when set free by Roman masters, became
Roman citizens by that very act.

4 ‘ The first powerful addition.’

⁶Potricr'us is simpl'y derived from parer, by annexing the adjec-
tive termination cius. Livy, therefore, is mistaken when, in an-
other passage, x. 8, he says that those were called patricians qut
patrem ciere assent, as if every one else had been spurius, ‘ille-
gitimate’ alricii is synonymous with patres.

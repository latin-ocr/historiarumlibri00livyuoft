Lmen xx1. 241

sit cum Saguntinis! Ad Iberum est Saguntum: nusquam
te vestigio moveris. Parum est quod veterrimas provincias

meas Siciliam et Sardiniam adimis: etiam Hispanias?
et inde cessero:¹ in Africam transcendes. Transcendes
autem, dieo 222 duos consules hujus anni, unum in Africam,
alterum in Hispaniam miserunt. Nihil unquam nobis
relictum est nisi quod armis vindicaremus.³ Illis timidis
et ignavis licet esse, qui respectum habent,⁴ quos sua terra,
suus ager per tuta ac pacata itinera fugientes accipient.
Vobis necesse est fortibus viris esse‚⁵ et omnibus inter vic-
toriam mortemve certa desperatione abruptis⁶ aut vincere
aut, si fortuna dubitabit‚⁷ in proelio potius quam in suga
mortem oppetere. Si hoc bene fixum omuibus, destinatum⁸
in animo est, iterum dicam, vicistis: nullum enim telum⁹
ad vincendum homini ab diis immortalibus acrius datum est.

 

 

every one of Hannibal's hearers knew, was not true. This is
brought sorward as a proos that the Romans set boundaries for
others which they did not keep themselves. Se movere vestigio,
‘ to move from the spot.’ *

² The speaker correers his expression; ¹ you will cross, Roman,
do I say 2’ No; it has been already done, and should be stated as
a past fact. Autem cannot be translated ; it takes up the preceding

⁴ ‘ Who have a retrospect 3⁷ that is, something to sall back upon,
and to trust to.

⁵ As with licet. so also with necesse est; besides the dative of the
person, another dative of the predicate with esse or some equivalent
verb may be used: thus for necesse esc vos esse viros sortes, also
vobis necesse est viris sortibus esse (haberi, vocari). In the same
manner, in xxiii. 29, we have quibus armatis desulcare mos est for
quos mos est armatos desultore. 'l'hese constructions are to be
accounted sor by attraction. Compare Zumpt, ᾗ 601,

⁵ ‘Everything between victory and death being broken off (cut

probably to be accounted sor thus: ¹Hannibal has this idea floating
in his mind, ⁶ we must conquer or dre ;’ and though he expresses it
in a manner which properly requires ‘and,’ still the ‘or' slips in.

'saulty. Another good conjecture besides that which we have iu-
corporated in our text, is nullum incitamentum.

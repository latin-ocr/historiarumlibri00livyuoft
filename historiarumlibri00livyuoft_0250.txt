cipem ac periculi socium haberem, et Hasdrubalem potius
quam Hannibalem hostem, et minorem haud dubie molem
belli: tamen curn praeterveherer navibus Galliae oram, ad
famam¹ hujus hostis in terram egressus, praemisso equitatu,
ad Rhodanum movi castra. Equestri proelio, qua parte
copiarum conserendi manum fortuna data est, hostem fudi3
pediturn agmen, quod in modurn fugientium raptim age·
batur, quia assequi terra non poteram, regressus ad naves,
quanta maxima potui celeritate, tanto maris terrarumque
circuitu in radicibus Alpium obvius sui.² Huic timendo
hosti utrum, cnm declinarem certamen, improvisus incidisse
videor an occurrere in vestigiis ejus‚³ lacessere ac trahere
ad decernendum? Experiri juvat utrum alios repente Car-
thaginienses per viginti annos terra ediderit,⁴ an iidem sint
qui ad Aegates pugnaverunt insulas7 et quos ab Eryce duo-
devicenis denariis aestimatos emisistis? et utrum Hannibal
hic sit aemulus itinerum Herculis, ut ipse fert, an vectigalis

¹Ad introducing a casual circumstance, ‘at;‘ for instance, ad
nuntium tam atrocem agmen constitit, ad tumultum Numidarum
equites eduxit: so here ⁴ at the report of this enemy ;’ that is,
when the news reached ine.

² To obuius fui the dative peditum agmini must be understood3
for the former clause, quia assequi non poteram, puts the noun ex-
pressed in che accuzativ9e. As to the construction quanta maxima

orto bc going to meet him on his sootsteps ;' that is, on his first
steps in Italy. Tam timendo is ironical; for by showing how much
he had hurried in order to meet Hannibal, Scipio has proved that
he did not sear the enemy at all.

⁴ ‘ Whether the earth, in the interval of twenty years, has sud-
denly given birth to another race of Carthaginians: he says ‘twenty
years’ in round numbers, though twenty-three had elapsed.

⁵ The Carthagiuian garrison in the town of Eryx (on the moun-
tain of the same name) in Sicily had obtained leave to quit in
safety, only upon condition os their paying to the Romans eighteen
denarii for each man. This appears to have been at the same time
one of the conditions of peace: of which, however, we have no
mention anywhere else in the historians.

⁶ A'strong expression, referring to the conditions of peace which
were lmposed by the Romans upon the conquered Carthaginians,
and which Hamilcar Barca, Hannibal's father, had accepted on the
part os his countrymen. The Carthaginiane are called stipendiarii,
because they had to pay a war contribution3 though now, after pay-
ing ofls the whole sum, they did not deserve the name. However,
their instalments were still going on, so long as Hamilcar was
alive ; and in so far he might be said to leave his son a stipeudzarius

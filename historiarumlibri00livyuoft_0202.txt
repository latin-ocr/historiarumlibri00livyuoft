agmine quadrato¹ amnem ingressus fugam ex ripa fecit,
vastatisque agris intra paucos dies Carpetanos quoque in
deditionem accepit. Et jam omnia trans Iberum praeter
Saguntinos Carthaginiensium erant.

6. Cum Saguntinis bellum nondum'erat, ceterum jam
belli cansa certamina cum finitimis serebantur? maxime
Turdetanis. Quibus cum adesset idem qui litis erat sator,
nec certamen juris sed vim quaeri appareret, legati a Sagun-
tinis Romam missi auxilium ad bellum jam haud dubie
imminens orantes. Consules tunc Romae erant P. Cor-
nelius Scipio et Ti. Sempronius Longus. Qui cum legatis
in senatum introductis de re publica rettulissent, placuis-
setque mitti legatos in Hispaniam ad res sociorum inspici-
endas, quibus si videretur digna causa, et Hannibali
denuntiarent³ ut ab Saguntinis sociis populi Romani absti-
neret, et Carthaginem in Africam trajicerent ac sociorum
populi Romani querimonias deferrent, hac legatione decreta
necdum missa, omnium spe⁴ celerius Saguntum oppugnari
allatum est. Tunc relata de integro res ad senatum, etalii
provincias consulibus Hispaniam atque Africam decernentes
terra marique rem gerendam censebant, alii totum in His-
paniam Hannibalemque intendebant⁵ bellum. Erant qui non
temere⁶ movendam rem tantam expectandosque ex Hispania
legatos censerent. Haec sententia, quae tutissima videbatur,

¹ Agmine quadrato is here nothing more than ‘in complete battle
order,' or 'in close array,' since there was no occasion sor a march
in square, which is necessary only when an attack from all sides at
once is anticipated. This was not the case here, for there were
now no enemies on the Carthaginian bank of the river. Hannibal,
aster forcing *back those of the enemy who had been crossing to
attack him, followed up his success by passing over the river him-
self with his army, and thus driving on the Spaniards, who were
consounded by their missortune in the river, still further.

² · Quarrels were excited‘—namely, between the Saguntines and
their neighbours-by Hannibal's means. He assisted the Turdetani,
although he pretended to wish to reconcile the parties.

³ Denuntiare. ‘ to declare,’ or ‘ give warning,’ commonly implying
a threat. We should expect qui as the subject ofthis verb, but the
relative pronoun is connected with the protasis, and must be supplied
to the apodosis. See Zumpt, ᾧ 804.

⁴ Spes, ¹ expectation,’ as frequently.

⁵Decernentes—intendebant, ‘decreeing‚ they directed the whole
war to Spain3' that is, gave their vote that the whole war should
be confined to Spain, Africa being left alone. Thus that which is
ξηῐεηάεά to be done is expressed by the simple verb. See Zumpt,

713.

⁰ ⁶ Not so hurriedly.’ Que in expectandosque, after the negation,
{ake} the force of an adversative particle, as sed. See Zumpt,

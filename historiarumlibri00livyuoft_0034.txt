him, under this latter name, the gens Julia at Rome deduced its
origin. Idem is ‘also,’ when one subject has two predicates3 for
example, Cicero orator idemque philosophus. Compare Zumpt,
ᾗ 697. The tradition, as given by Dionysius, is this, that Aeneas
had two sons, Ascanius by Creusa, and Silvius by Lavinia. The
son of Ascanius was Iulus, who. being supplanted by his uncle
Silvius, did not succeed to the crown at his father’s death, but‘lived
in the odour ofsancffly, and became the founder ofthe Julian gens.
Several other Roman gentes had the vanity to deduce their descent
from demigods or heroes, (in the Greek sense of the word); the
gen-s Fabia, for instance, from Hercules and a daughter of Evander.
See note, i. 49. The fame, however, of the Julii has made then·
descent better known.

¹At the time when Rome assumed authority over Latium, the
Latin towns were divided into ‘old' and ⁴ neW.⁷ The former were
thirty in number, and formed a confederation. New Latium (novum
Latium) consisted of a number of townships on the borders of old
Latium, which were subdued by the Romans, or by them in con-
junctior] with the old Latius, and placed in the same relation ιο
Rome as old Latium. According to Livy, these old Latius were
originally colonists srom Lavinium and Alba ; iu the opinion of other
ancient historiatis they werc not colonists‚ but merely recognised
the pre-eminence os Alba. Aricia. Tusculum, Praeneste, Lanu-
vium, and Tibur, were among these eld Latin towns.

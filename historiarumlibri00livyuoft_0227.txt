LIBER xxi. 213

habent quidam annales, alii P. Cornelium Asinam et C.
Papirium Masonem. Id quoque dubium est, legati ad
expostulandum missi ad Boios violati sint, an in triumviros
agrum metantes impetus sit factus.¹ Mutinae cum obside-

rentur, et gens ad oppugnandarum urbium artes rudis,
pigerrima eadem ad militaria opera,2 segnis intactis assi-

deret muris‚ simulari coeptum de pace ag13³ evocatique
ab Gallorum principibus legati ad colloquium non -contra
jus modo gentium, sed violata etiam, quae data in id
tempus erat, fide‚⁴ comprehenduntur, negantibus Gallis,
nisi obsides sibi redderentur, eos dimissuros. Cum haec de
legatis nunciata essent et Mutina praesidiumque in periculo
esset, L. Manlius praetor ira accensus effusum agmen⁵ ad
Mutinam ducit. Silvae tunc circa viam erant, plerisque‘
incultis. Ibi inexplorato⁷ profectus, in insidias praecipi-
tatus, multa cum caede suorum aegre in apertos campos

¹ ¹ Whether they, being sent as ambassadors to the Boii, to call
thern to account, were injured (contrary to the law os nations)‚
or an attack was made upon them when, as triumvirs, they were
measuring the ground! The legatiand the triumviri were the same
persons. looked upon in different relations3 and it is certain that
they fell into the hands of the Gauls: the doubtful point is, on what
occasion, tlizndier what circumstances, and in what capacity, they
were attae e .

⁸ ‘And at the same time also uncommonly slow at military la-
bours.¹ As to idem, when two predicates are given to one subject,
see Zumpt, ᾧ 697. Opera are manual exertions—such as the erec-
tion of besieging towers, the throwing up os mounds, and the like:
militaria, ‘such as become, or are necessary to soldiers'—that is,
according to the notioris of Romans.

³ Equivalent to coeperunt simulare se de pace ager& the passive,
however, implies no definite subject, but some such as the French
on, o'r German man. See Gram. ὑ 234, note 1.

⁴ ‘ With the violation of the promise of personal safety‚ which had
'³9³9 given for that particular time‘—that is, the time of the nego· ,
tration.

⁵ ‘The army not inclose orders for agmen is an army on the

march, just as acies is one in battle array; and effusum means ‘ what
is not kept together—straggling.'

⁶Ablative from the neuter pleraque, ‘most of the places‚’ ‘the
greater part of the country.’

⁷ *Ἧέῑὶιοιιῑ reconnoitring.’ Adverb formed according to Gram.

tentare; see Zumpt, ὗ 12, middle) is here: aggredi, ¹ to attempt to
gain possession of a thing.

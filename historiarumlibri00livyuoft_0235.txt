liae sit‘‚¹ in ipsis portis hostium fatigatos subsistere, quid

Fingerent altiores Pyrenaei³ jugis: nullas profecto terras
coelum contingere neo inexsuperabiles humano generi esse.
Alpes quidem habitari, coli, gignere atque alere animantes3
pervias paucis esse nec invias exercitibus esse.⁴ Eos ipsos
quos cernant, legatos non pinnis⁵ sublime elatos Alpes trans-
gressos3 ne majores quidem eorum indigenas, sed advenas
Italiae cultores has ipsas Alpes ingentibus saepe agminibus⁶
cum liberis ac conjugibuS‚ migrantium modo, tuto trans-
misisse. Militi quidem armato, nihil secum praeter instru-
menta belli portanti, quid invium aut inexsuperabile esse?
Saguntum ut caperetur, quid per octo menses periculi, quid
laboris exhaustum esse? Romam, caput orbis terrarum,
petentibus quicquam adeo asperum atque arduum videri,
quod inceptum moretur? Cepisse quondam Gallos ea, quae
adiri posse Poenus desperet.⁷ Proinde aut cederent animo

heights) 2⁹—a question involved in the partieipial construction=et

³ The Pyrenees are called by Livy either mons Pyrenaeus, or
montes Pyrenaei, or, omitting the substantive, Pyrenaeus or Py-
renaez.
⁴ ‘ The Alps could (easily) be crossed by a few, and were not im-
passable for armies even.' We have here been forced to admit a
conjecture into the text 3 for in the manuscripts the reading is per-
vias paucis esse exercitibus, where it is clear that between esse and
exercitibus one or two words have slipped our. The ordinary read-
ing is pervias paucis esse, exercitibus invias ?—which gives the same
sense in the form of a question. But this form appears to us unsuit-
able ; for, in the first place, there is a very great difference between
a few crossing the Alps and a whole army; and, admitting the pos-
'sibility of the former, that of the latter by no means follows as a
matter of course3 and, in the second place, such a question was not
needed, since the practicability of conducting whole armies over
giesi? mounItailns had been demonstrated by the immigration of the
au s into ta . ·
⁶ The manushripts have pinni& and this is more correct than the
ordinary reading penui& for we distinguish between penna, ‘ a fea-
ther in general,¹ and pinna, ‘a wing-feather or wing.' As to sub-
lime, see Gram. ᾗ 219, 3.
⁶ ‘ In immense hosts.’ As to this abladve, see Gram. ὗ 293, with
note 1, and Zumpt, ᾧ 473.
⁷ The Gauls had once taken Rome, in 390 B.c.‚ and Hannibal
thinks that the Carthaginians need not despair of reaching the point
which had been attained by those whom they had so recemly con·
quered.

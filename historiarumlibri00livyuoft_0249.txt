paene perierint quam supersunt‚¹ plus spei nactos esse. At
enim² pauci quidem sunt, sed vigentes animis corpori-
busque, quorum robora ac vires vix sustinere vis ulla possit.
Effigies, immo umbrae³ hominum, same, frigore, illuvie,
squalore enecti, contusi ac debilitati inter saxa rupesque.
Ad hoc praeusti artus, nive rigentes nervi, membra torpida
gelu,⁴ quassata fractaque arma, claudi ac debiles equi. Cum
hoc equite, cum hoc pedite pugnaturi estis;⁵ reliquias ex-
tremas hostium, non hostes habebitis. Ac nihil magis
vereor- quam ne, vos cum pugnaveritis, Alpes vicisse Han-
nibalem videantur. Sed ita forsitan decuit, cum foederum
ruptore duce ac populo deos ipsos, sine ulla humana ope,
committere ac profligare bellurn, nos, qui secundum deos

²'1'his clause and the preceding evidently contradict each other.
If Hannibal had lost two-thirds of his force (sor this, according to
the Latin idiom, is the meaning of duae partes, see Gram. ᾗ 110),
then it is plainly incorrect to say that almost more had perished than
had survived. We can only suppose that the orator sorgot to ex-
press the ⁸ almost⁷ in the former clause.

² An objection which the orator supposes to proceed from one os
his hearers: ‘But, some one may say.' As to the subjunctive
eofflirtt'mzedisgassdns 3r3digs’a3ys the previous word. putting a stronger
ιη tts place: ⁴ they are images—no, not lmageS, but mere shadows
of men! Effigies is ‘an image,’ ‘representation ;‘ for example, a
statue—which is, or should be, a copy of its subject, the man him-
self. This, however, though it be but a copy. is decidedly more
material than the man’s shadow. See Zumpt, ὑ 277. fin.

⁴ Torpida, ‘stiffi benumbed,’ is a conjecture os Rubenius, but
con-eet: sor the manuscript reading, torrida, cannot, according to
Latin usage, be understood in the sense of usta or praeusta (⁴ srozen
at the extremities'), of the operation of frost.
ς {4‘9You are about to fight,‘ more than pugnabitis. See Gram.

⁰ ‘ It is perhaps right (or fate has very properly so decreed) that
the gods should begin and decide this war, and that we, who have
been injured next to the gods, should finish it.' Profligare is to get
over the difficulties of an affair3 so that the final confectio rei, the
complete settlement, is easy.

⁷As vestri is the enitive plural of tu, we should expect the
plural of the particip e, adhortandorum but it is not so, sor we
always find nostri, vestri. and sui, even when they are plurale,
joined with participles in the singular. As to this and its explana·
tion, see Gram. ὗ 113, note 3, ᾗ 396, note l, and Zumpt, ὑ 660.

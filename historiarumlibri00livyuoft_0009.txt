From PRor. J. F. Ricniunsm«, Madison Universsty, Oct. 27, 1849.

1 gave the Grammar at once a very caresul exa-minatmn, and have no hesitation m

of the year your edition of Virgil and probably also that of Caesar, both of which 1 pretet

Fr⁰m PRor. J. J. Owen, Free Academy, .N'ew Yorlt‚ Aug. 31, 1849.

1 am highly pleased with your excellent publications of the above series, and 35 an evi-
donce of the estimation in which Ι hold them, on my recommendation, your virga has
been adopted as 3 text-book in the Free Aoademy in this city. 1 shall be happy to com-
mend your series to all with whom I may have any influeuce.

 

From Pssor. J. B. Honson, Oberlz'n C'oHege, 0., Oct. 12, 1850.

1 have examined the series of Elementary Classics published by Lea ἁ Blanchard. and
take great pleasure in sayine that I regard them as admirably adopted to secure the object

printing and punctuation of these books than' in almost an >11101115 of a similar character
that 1 have seen. The maps too are a great help-an 111 ispensable one indeed to ‚the
great majority of students who have no ancient atlas—m understajdmg the geographical
allusions contained in the text. The selection of notes 15 judlcious; and the whole
design and execution of the series commend it to the notice of those who wxsh to become
independent and sels-relying scholars.

 

From PRoF. J. Premnn, ἸἹιεῧίῗὲἱεέἔὉ-ςείέξῧατῃ, Fairfaz county, Virginia,
arc ..·,., .

The size of the volume, the beauty and correctness of the text, and the judicious
notes, not boo copious to supersede tho industry of the cupii, seem to me to leave nothing
to be desii-ed. 1 doubt not your enterprise m'll be rewarded by your editions taking the

lace of others now in mse. to which there are many objectionS, and 1 will do what 111 me
'es to promote their circulation.

 

From PRor. J . S. Bonssm„ Frederick Collega, Mat, March 18, 1850.

Having used the first three volumes of the series sor more than a year, Ι 3111 free to

From PRor. J. Fonsr'm, Collega of Now Jersw, ,March 19, 1850.

1 am happy in being able to say that every successive volume lias confirmed me in the
judgment formed on those first issued, and renexvs my delight that you have resolved to
place the whole of th1s admirable senes of classmal authors within the reach of Ameri—
can students. The Grammar is already in ‘use in this college; and I shall cordially
reoommend our students to procure your edinons of such authors as we read. '

 

From T. J. SAWYER, EsQ., c'linton Liberat Institutae, ,March 28, 1850.

We have paid them the ‚compliment of making them our text-books and introducing
them at once into this institute. In sxze and prlce, in design and execution, they seem
to me better fitted for schools of this class than any others that have fallen under my
observatiam Α neat and accurate text, and brief, but explicit notes, constitute the prin-
cipal characteristics of a good classica] school book. These distinguish your series, and
give them a claim to general diffusion.

 

From tlte REV. J. J. SMY'ra. A. Μ., Sussez court House, Va„ April 6, 1850.

Whjle at the head of the Petersburg Classical Institute‚l introduced your Caesar. Virgil
and Sallust, 35 being in my judgment the best school editions of these πνοι-115 that 1 have
seen. Since I have been in my present pastoral charge, 1 have been the means of having
the Caesar and Sallust introduced into two schools in this county. These works are a
happy medium between the mere text and the overloaded annotations which render
corne editions but the clandestine refuge of idle school-boys.

 

From Pm-:smewr MANLY, University of Aloboma, March 29, 1850.

So far as l may be consulted, or have influence, Ι shall seek to recommend‘the nse of
this well-edited and cheap serieS, in all the preparatory schools of our region. 3

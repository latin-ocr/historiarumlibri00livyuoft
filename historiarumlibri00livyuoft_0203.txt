vicit3 legatique eo maturius missi, P. Valerius Flaccus et Q.
Baebius Tamphilus, Saguntum ad Hannibalem atque inde
Carthaginem, si non absisteretur bello, ad ducem ipsum in
poenam foederis rupti deposcendum.

7. Dum ea Romani parant consultantque‚¹ jam Saguntum
summa vi oppugnabatur. Civitas ea longe opulentissima
ultra lberum suit, sita passus mille ferme a mari. Oriundi
a Zacyntho insula dicuntur‚² mixtique etiam ab Ardea
Rutulorum quidam generis: ceterum in tantas³ brevi cre·
verant opes seu maritimis seu terrestribus fructibus‚⁴ seu
multitudinis incremento, seu disciplinae sanctitate,⁵ qua
fidem socialem usque ad perniciem suam coluerunt. Han-
nibal infesto exercitu ingressus fines, pervastatis passim
agris, urbem tripartito aggreditur. Angiilus inuri erat in
planiorem patentioremque quam cetera circa vallem vergens.
Adversus eum vineas⁶ agere instituit, per quas aries moen-
ibus admoveri posset. Sed ut locus procul muro satis
aequus agendis vineis suit, ita haudquaquam prospere, post-
quam ad effectum operis ventum est, coeptis succedebat!
Et turris ingens imminebat, ⁹ et murus, ut in suspecto loco,
supra ceterae modum altitudinis emunitus erat, et juventus
delecta, ubi plurimum periculi ac timoris ostendebatur, ibi
vi majore obsistebant. Ac primo missilibus summovere

² The transition from the name of a city to the inhabitants is not
uncommon in the ancient writers, and is the more natural here, since
the word civitas is used, which properly points to the citizens. not
to the buildings osa town. The island of Zac uthos is now called
Zante, situated near the west coast of the ll* orea; the Rutulians
were an ancient tribe on the borders of Latium in Ardea, which,
long before this time, had become a Latin colony.

³ ⁴ To such a power3' namely, as they had at the time of this war

with Hannibal.
⁴ §Profits from the sea (that is, from fisheries particularly), or

from the land (from the successful cultivation of the soil).'

⁶ Disciplina is the mode of regulating the domestic and public life,
‘education and manner os lit'east which in Saguntum was sancta,
‘pure and blamelessff

⁸ Vineae were covered wallis, so called srorn their externat resem-
blance to bowers formed of vines, under which the assailants osa
town could attack the wall without danger. Aries—literally
ram' —was a heavy bearn tipped with uon, which was used sor yb-at
tering at walls or gates.

⁷ Succedit impersonally; succedit coeptis: coepta succedunt. In the
sarni} manner fraus succedit, or fraudi succedit, ‘the fraud is suc·

⁸ ‘ There was a great tower near, commanding the wall.’

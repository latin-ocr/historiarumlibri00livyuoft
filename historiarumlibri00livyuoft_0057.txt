post Numae regnum clausus fuit, semel T. Manlio consule‚¹
post Punicum primum perfectum bellum, iterum, quod nos·
trae aetati dii dederunt ut videremus, post bellum Actiacum
ab imperatore Caesare Augusto, pace terra marique parta.
Clauso e'o cum omnium circ-a finitimorum societate ac foederi-
bus junxisset animos, positis externorum periculorum curis,
ne luxuriarent² otio animi, quos metus hostium disciplinaque
militaris continuerat, omnium primum rem ad multitudinem
imperitam et illis saeculis rudem efficacissimam, deorum
metum injiciendum ratus est.³ Qui curn descendere ad ani-
mos sine aliquo commento miraculi non posset, simulat sibi
cum dea Egeria congressus nocturnos esse: ejus se monitu,
quae acceptissima‘² diis essent, sacra instituere, sacerdotes suos
cuique deorum praeficere. Atque omnium primurn ad cursus
lunae in duodecim menses describit annum,5 quem, quia
tricenos dies singulis mensibus luna non explet, desuntque dies
solido ann0, qui solstitiali circumagitur orbe, intercalares
menses interponendo ita dispensavit, ut vicesimo anno⁵ ad
metam eandem solis, unde orsi essent5 plenis omnium annorum
spatiis dies congruerent. Idem nefastos dies fastosque fecit,
quia aliquando nihil cum populo agi⁷ utile futurum erat.

and peace, whose actual origin was unknown, were attributed to
Numa, the annalists invented the story that Numa erected the
Janus, and made the regulations regarding it.

conquest, however, was not permanent.

⁶Before the time of Numa, the year had been divided into ten
months of various lengths, probably according to the rising of the
constellations which regulated agriculture. Traces of this old di-
vision were to be seen in the names of Quintilis ,(Ju1y). Sextilis
(August), and still exist in September, October, November, Decem-
ber. These names are plainly derived from the Latin numerals, the
nurnbering being made from March, which was the ›first month.
Numa divided the year into twelve months, adding Januarius and

, Februarius, with the latter of which he closed it. These twelve

months were lunar, oftwenty-eight days each, and therefore, in order
to adjust the year to the course of the sun, a whole lunar rnonth addi-
tlonal had to be inserted every few years. These inserted months
were called menses intercalares.

{This is the reading of the manuscripts; the more modern
editions read quarto et vicesimo quoqueanno. This. however, is not
necessary for the adjustment ofthe lunar to the solar year.

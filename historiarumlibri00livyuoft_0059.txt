lica privataque sacra pontificis scitis subjecit, ut esset quo
consultum plebes veniret‚¹ ne quid divini juris negligendo
patrios ritus peregrinosque adsciscendo turbaretur; nec coel-
estes modo ceremonias, sed justa quoque funebria placan-
dosque manes ut idem pontifex edoceret, quaeque prodigia
fulminibus aliove quo visu² missa susciperentur atque cura-

in Aventino dicavit, deumque consuluit auguriis, quae suscip-
ienda essent.

21. Ad haec consultanda procurandaque multitudine omni
‘ a vi et armis conversa, et animi aliquid agendo occupati
erant, et deorum assidua insidens cura, cum interesse rebus
humanis coeleste numen videretur, ea pietate omnium pec-
tora imbuerat, ut fides ac jusjurandum proxime legum ac
poenarum metum³ civitatem regerent. Et cum ipsi se ho-

roll ofthe gods, the list ostheir revenues, which were derived princi-
pally from landed property, and were devoted to defraying the
expenses of sacrifices, διο. The college of pontifices, with the
pontifex maximus at its head. had full authority from the state to
superintend and manage everything connected with the worship of
the gods. Their duties included also the performance of funeral
rites‚ and tlte preservation of public documents.

² ⁵ That the plebs might have a place to which they could go and
appty for advice.’

² Visus, properly ‘ a seeing;’ here, as frequently, ‘ a thing seen,
an appearance ;' suscipere, ‘to take up as,‘ ‘to regard as.’ Compare
xliii. 13, duo non suscepta prodigia sunt. Curare or procurare, ⁸ to
take care 0f3' that is ‘to perform such religious ceremonies as might
make the best of a prodigy, preparing the way for the reception of
any good which was prognosticated, and averting as far as possible
any threatened calamity.

⁸ ⁴ Like the sear of law and punishment.' Propior, proximus, pro-
pius, and proxime, being derived from the preposition prope, ‘nean'
may govern the accusative. The manuscripts read proximo metu,
and proxime metum is merely a conjecture of Muretus. This con—
jecture, however, is preferable to the manuscript reading, because,
according to the latter, the melus legum ac poenarum, though nct so
influential as the fides ac jusjurandum, still exists and operates;
whereas the former implies that the metus, not being necessary for
the preservation of sociat order, is entirely gone, and that a strong
religious feeling has come in its place.

⁴ Unicus refers not to ¹number, but to excellence, ‘ pre-eminent in
its kind! Compare xxu. 14.

⁵Ame is here not the preposition, as its position before cantra
might lead un to think, but an adverb, equivalent to antea.

erat, in Hispaniam, ut adirent civitates, ut¹ in societatem
perlicerent aut averterent a Poenis, trajecerunt. Ad Bar-
gusios-² primum venerunt, a quibus benigne excepti, quia
taedebat imperii Punici, multos trans Iberum populos ad
cupidinem novae fortunae erexerunt. Ad Volcianos inde
est ventum, quorum celebre per Hispaniam responsum cete-
ros populos ab societate Romana avertit. Ita enim maxi-
mus natu ex iis in concilio respondit. ‘Quae verecundia est,
Romani, postulare vos³ uti vestram Carthaginiensium amici-
tiae pi'aeporiamuS, cum qui id fecerunt, Saguntinos crudelius,
quam Poenus hostis perdidit, vos socii prodideritistss Ibi
quaeratis-'² socios censeo, ubi Saguntina clades ignota est. His-
panis populis, sicut lugubre, ita insigne documentum Sagunti
ruinae erunt, ne quis fidei Romanae aut societati confidat!
Inde extemplo abire finibus Volcianorum jussi ab nullo deinde
concilio Hispaniae benigniora verba tulere. Ita nequicquam
peragrata Hispania in Galliam transeunt.

armati (ita mos gentis erat) in concilium venerunt. Cum
verbis extollentes gloriam virtutemque populi Romani ac
magnitudinem imperii petissent, ne Poeno bellum Italiae
infercuti per agros urbesque suas transitum darent, tantus
cum fremitu risus dicitur ortus, ut vix a magistratibus
majoribusque natu juventus sedaretur: adeo stolida impu

 

¹ This clause, ut perlicerent, depends on the preceding ut adn-ent
—an awkward and clumsy construction: ‘to visit the states, in order
that they might induce thern to become allies.’

² We know nothing either of the Spanish tribe or of the Volciani,
who are mentioned next. lt is plain, however (indeed, as to the
Bargusians, Livy, in chap. 23, mentions the fact), that they belonged
to those tribes which were settled between the Pyrenees and the
Iberus (Ebro); for the efforts of the Roman ambassadors could ex·
tend only over this part of Spain, since, had they crossed the Ebro,
they might justly have been punished by the Carthaginiens. Livy's
casual statement that taedebat eos imperii Punici, and that the minds
of many tribes beyond the Iberus were excited by the Roman am-
bassadors, may be supposed to contradict our theory. Their hatred
of the Punic government‚ however, need not be referred to expe-
rience, but to the sear of what was clearly imminent; and the incli-
nation of a tribe on this side of the Iberus towards the Romans
might very well stir up others beyond the river.

Schmitz and Zumpt’s Classical Series—Continued.

 

From J. S. BonsALn, ESQ„ Fraderick college, Md.. Feb. 5, 1849.

1 have examined them, and find thein on all points what the reputation os the eminent
editors led me to expect fron] them, and what they design the books to be.

I know not that l can give you a better proof 01' the estimation in which Ι hold them.
than by simply saying that Ι ani already usnig Caesar and Virgil os the series in niy classes,
and expect very soon to introduce sallust.

 

From Pitor. N. L. Lmnsnmr, Curnhcrland University, Terin„ Νου. 22, 1848.

1 ani very favourably impressed with the merits of Schniitz and Zumpt's classical series.
So far as my engagements have permitted nie to examine the ¹· VirgiF' and “Sallust.’¹ Ι
am indnced to believe that they are superior to the other editions in common use„

l shall take pleasure in recommending them to [eac-hers and students in this vicinity.

From Paor. Gessnmz HARiusoN, University of Virginia. Νου. 3, 1848.

Ι very decidedly approve of the plan of publishing cheap editions of the classics. with
ffizfssotefflsfgzssig *use of schools, and shall reconiinend this edition to my friends, as suit-

 

From PRor. W. S. Tvnnn, fimiter-st Collegae, Mass„ Dec. 25, 1848.

The notes are pertinent and pithy, as well as accurate and learned, and contrast to
great advantage with some whose chief reconiinendation is, that they are deSigned to
atone sor the indolence os the student by the supererogatory works os the editor.

 

From Jonn S. ΗΑΚΤ, LL.D.‚ Central Higli Sclwol, Plciladdphz‘a, Dec. 14, 1848.

Ι have examined, with much satisfaction, your editions of Virgil and Sallust, being con-
tinuations of your reprint of Schniitz and Zumpt's classical series, and take pleasure iu
renewing the reconiniendation which Ι gave to the plan of the series on the appearance
of Caesar, The notes are admirably adapted to the precrse wants of the learner, giving in
small space {lu the necessary facibtres, without superseding the necessity of diligent and
accurate stu y.

 

stom C. W. Ενειῐεςτ, Εερ., Rectory school, Hamden, Ut„ Dec. 7, 1848.

From the brief examination Ι have been able to give them, I feel very much pleased
with them, both as regards the execution of your own part of the plau, and also that of
your abssel editors„ Such text-books are much needed. Instead οξ them, we have been

be sure 1 shall be happy to adopt them as text-books in niy school.

 

From WM. Β. porra Orwigsburg, Pa„ Νου- 28, 1848.

l have devoted sufficient time to the examination of your editions of Caesar. Virgss, and
Sallust, to enable ine to form an estimare of their respective ments. Ι do not hesitate tn
say that the uniformity and cheapness of the works, with the notes of the learned eddom,
sufficiently illustrative οἱ the style and sentimeuts of tlie authors, and yet not so voluini-
nous as to obviate the necessity of cau-esni stndy on the part os the student. must recom-
mend them to the favourable consideration οἱ those engaged in teaclnng this interestmg
branch oi' literature. We shall certainly adnpt this series in the ucfflleiny.

 

From WM. Ε’πΑῐιΝΕΤε, Eso.⁷ Nozfolk, Va.⁷ N'ov. 20, 1848.

{return you my thanks sur the copies os Virgil und Sallust sent tome. The professor
of languages in the Norsolk acadeiny has introduced [lieni in this school. and we think
they will be used in all schools, as soon ns known ιο theni. I shall recoiuinend them to
al] the teachers of my acquaintance.

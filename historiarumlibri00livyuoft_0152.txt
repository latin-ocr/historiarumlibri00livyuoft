¹ From Livy’s description, it appears that the dictator, by virtue
of his unlimited power, had completed the levy, but had made the
troops swear obedience not to himself, but to the consuls os the year.
We must take it so, though it seem strange: we read a little above,
however, that the dictator had not, as usual, named a magister
equitum, but had intrusted the command ostwo armies to the consuls.
It seems probable, therefore, that he was appointed solely for the
purpose of holding the levy.

² Religio exsolvitur, ‘the obligation is cancelled.' can be said
equally well with religione exsolvor. The accusative with the infini-
tive after dicitur occurs sometimes. though but rarely. See Gram.
ᾖ 247, and Zumpt, ᾗ 607, note. It can be explained here, where
there are two clauses, by supplying the active form de'cunt out ot
the preceding passive dicitur.

³ One of the oldest Roman annalists‚ who was also a distinguished
state-sman, tribune ofthe plebs in 149, and consul in 133 Bc He
was Sssmamedfistugi' and has been mentioned by Livy before this

⁴ The firogeration of the plebeians is worthy of immortal praise3
but it should not be forgotten that near Mons Sacer, beyond the
Anio, was situated the property of the Tribus Claudia (see ii. 16),
and that that tribe, hostile ιο, and bitrerly hated by the plebs. had
to bear the greater part of the burden of their support. The violence

of the plebeians in taking corn by force is sarcastically alluded to by
Coriolanus in the senate, chap. 34.

⁶ The fathers were not sure themselves whether it would be more
advantageous to them that the plebeians still in the city should
secede or remain.

⁶ The infinitives are of different kinds, some of them belonging
to the oratio obliqua, and ducere being an historical infinitive.

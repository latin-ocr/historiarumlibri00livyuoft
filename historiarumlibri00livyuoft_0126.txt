² Gronovius wished incipiat, which Cicero, at all events, would
have used. Livy, however, is fond of the plural with such expres-
sions as quis ue, pro se quisque, because, with a singular form, the
meaning is p ural.

³ It is doubtful whether circumarare is merely used sor ararat-e, or
means, ‘ to go round with the plough.' Dionysius favours the latter
sense by his use of the verb περιαροῦν. 'l'his word, however, might
lie under the same ambiguity, were it not that, in describing a pre-
sent, unquestionably of the same kind, to Mucius Scaevola, the un-
mistakable expression ἀρότρῳ περιλαβεῖν, ‘to encompass (take round)
with the plough.' is employed. Seneca too (de benef. vii. 7), says,
that to a commander (imperator) there had been given tantum agri,
quantum arando uno die circuire osset: this, however, on account
os the term imperator, cannot re er to Horatius Cocles, but seems
rather to apply to the consul Μ’. Curius. who conquered the Sam-
nites and Sabines more than two hundred years after this time. The
present of as much land as a farmer could plough up with a team of
oxen in one day (jugum agri) seems much more consistent with the
limited dominion and comparative poverty of the young republic,
than such a large gift as the litera! translation of circumamre indi-
catefs. d Still, the whole story is mythical, and we must leave it as
we n it.

⁴ Here we should expect ipsum, but this passage is a proof, one
of many, that the Latin idiom, in this connection, is generally to
join the ipse with the subject. See Zumpt, ὑ 696, and Livy, xxii. 60.

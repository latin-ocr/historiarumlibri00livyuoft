militari sagulo opertum, numi jacentem inter custodias
stationesque militum conspexerunt. Vestitus nihil inter
aequales excellens: arma atque equi conspiciebantur} Equi-
tum peditumque idem longe primus erat: princeps in proe-
lium ibat, ultimus conserto proelio² excedebat. Has tantas
viri virtutes ingentia vitia aequabant, inhumana crudelitas,
perfidia plus quam Punica? nihil veri, nihil sancti, nullus
deum metus, nullum jusjurandum, nulla religio. Cum hac
indole virtutum atque vitiorum triennio sub Hasdrubale im-
peratore meruit, nulla re quae agenda videndaque⁴ magno
futuro duci esset praetermissa.

5. Ceterum ex quo die dux est declaratus,⁵ velut Italia
ei provincia decreta bellumque Romanum mandatum esset,
nihil prolatandum ratus, ne se quoque, ut patrem Hamil-
carem, deinde Hasdrubalem, cunctantem casus aliquis op-
primeret, Saguntinis inferre bellum statuit. Quibus oppug-
nandis quia haud dubie Romana arma movebantur, in
Olcadum prius fines (ultra Iberum ea gens in parte magis
quam in dicione Carthaginiensium erat) induxit exercitum,

and then he could find repose on a hard bed and in the midst of
norse.

² ‘ When the troops had come to close quarters :' he never went
out of the sray till the contest was decided.

³ Romana fides and Punica per dia were proverbial expressions
among the Romans. These qua itics had no doubt their origin in
the avocations respectively pursued by the two nations—the Ro-
mans being principally agriculturists, the Carthaginians merchants
and seamen. In international proceedings, neither state was much
better than the other in regard to perfidia, though the Romans took
great paine to maintain the appearance of faithfully keeping the
treatles.

⁴ He strove to learn to see and know everything with his own eyes.

⁵ Hannibal entered on his command in the year 221 Bc, and de-
voted this year and the two following to the extension of the Car·
thaginian dominion in Spain, and the preparation of means sor his
invasion of Italy. His immedrate predecessor, Hasdrubal, had
(chap. 2) ruled in Spain for eight years, and his predecessor, Hamil-
car, for nine. 'I'o these twenty yearS, if we add the ·three during
which the Carthaginians were engaged in the African war with
their mercenaries, we have the whole twenty-three years which
elapsed between the conclusion of the first Punic war (241 Bc) and
the outbreak of the second (218 13.c.). It appears from this compu-
tation that Polybius, who assigns somewhat more than three years
to the African war, is more correct than Livy, who (chap. 1) ives
five years. As Hannibal was nine years old at the time of his sat er's
departure for Spain, and Hamilcar aud Hasdrubal had governed for
seventeen years, he must have been twenty-six years of age when
lie assumed the command.

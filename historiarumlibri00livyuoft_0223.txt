¹ Pedites caetrati. soot—soldiers, who, instead of the scutum or the
clipeos, were armed with the caetra (or cetra), which was a kind of
shield peculiar to the Spaniards, probably made of hurdle-work,
covered with a stout hide, light, and similar to the Greek pelta; sor
which reason Livy, in xxxi. 36, gives the name of caetrati to the
Greek peltasts, a kind of infantry, occupying a middle position be-

tween hoplites and light-armed troops.
² ‘ Balearic slingers ;’ for the inhabitants of the Balearic islands,

offthe south-east coast of Spain, were famed during all antiquity
sor their skill in throwing with accuracy stones or leaden balls a
distance of six hundred paces with the sling (funda). For this
reason they were, in later times, favourite auxiliaries in the Roman
armies.

⁵ Libyphoenices were those su bjects of Carthage who had sprung
from marriages between the immigrant Phoenicians and native
Africans. They ranked next, therefore, to the proper Carthaginians,
the ruling Phoenician citizens of the capital, and probably inhabited
the smaller towns in the Carthaginian territory.

⁶ The Ilergetes were a considerable Spanish tribe on this side of
the Iberus, in the modern district of Catalonia. Their chief town
was Ilerda (now Lerida). This little band of two hundred cavalry
had no doubt volunteered for pay imo the Carthaginian service, sor
their tribe was not subject to Carthage.

cunctatione et socordia jarn nuc progressus Tantum, pro!
degeneramus a patribus nostris⁷ ut praeter quam oram
illi suam¹ Punicas vagari classes dedecus esse imperii sui
duxerint, earn nunc plenam hostium Numidarumque ac
Maurorum jam factam videamus? Qui modo Saguntum
oppugnari indignando² non homines tantum sed foedera
et deos ciebamus, scandentem moenia Romanae coloniae
Hannibalem laeti³ spectamus. Fumus ex incendiis villarum
agrorumque in oculos atque ora venit; strepunt aures cla-
moribus plorantium sociorum, saepius nos quam deorum
invocantium opem. Nos hic pecorum modo per aestivos
saltus⁴ deviasque calles exercitum ducimus7 conditi nubibus
silvisque. Si hoc modo peragrando cacumina saltusque M.
Furius recipere a Gallis urbem voluisset, quo hic novus
Camillus, nobis dictator unicus⁵ in rebus affectis quaesituS,
Italiam ab Hannibale recuperare parat, Gallorum Roma
esset; quam vereor ne, sic cunctantibus nobis, Hannibali ac
Poenis totiens⁶ servaverint majores nostri. Sed vir ac vere
Romanus, quo die dictatorem eum ex auctoritate Patrum
jussuque populi dictum Veios allatum est, cum esset satis
altum Janiculum⁷ ubi sedens prospectaret hostem, descendit
in aequum, atque illo ipso die media in urbe, qua nuuc busta

 

¹ We have, in accordance with the best manuscripts, introduced
suam, which is iu other editions groundlessly omitted. As to the
eam, emphatically pointing back to quam, see Zumpt, ὓ 813.

² ¹ In the expression of our indignation at the siege os Saguntum,
= indignantes, or cum· ind· nubantur.

³The modern editions ave lenti, ‘ with equanimity or indiffer-
cnce,’ which is good; but laeti, the manuscript reading, is equally
good, and perhaps even more suited to the spirit of the orator and
os his hearers. Such a word as laeti here must have acted like an
electric spark upon the souls of the young officers who surrounded
the master of the horse.

⁴The mountains on which the Romans had their position are
called ‘ Summer Hills,' because in summer they were used as pas-¹
ture· round. This is the case still.

⁶ nicus means ‘the only one of his kind, distinguished above all
others’—here of course ironical. '
Z ⁰ This§is the correct spelling, instead of the ordinary toties. See

umpt, 122.

⁷ The orator thinks that M. Furius Camillus might, had he chosen,
have taken up his position on a hill overlooking the enemy—the
Janiculum, for instance, which was high enough sor the purpose;
but instead of doing so, he descended into the plain, and went in
search of the enemy, falling in with thern at a place which was
afterwards called Busta Gallorum, from the number of Gauls slain
and buried there. The speaker, or Livy, who moves the puppet‚
naturally follows the popular story that Camillus, by acts of hero-
ism, rcscued Rome from Brennus.

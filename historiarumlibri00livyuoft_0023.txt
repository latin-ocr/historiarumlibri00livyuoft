(Cadiz) to Rome solely for the purpose os seeing the author of the
reat history, and returned as soon as he had satisfied his curiosity.
ἰίνγέ work is an admirable digest of all the materials existing for
a history of Rome. His purpose in undertaking it (and this very
purpose shows us his own beautiful and amiable character) was to
draw, with all the chartus which his artistic skill and delicate taste
could ive, a complete picture of the history of the Roman people,
and olgthe laudable or blameworthy peculiarities of its prominent
personages, that thereby he might inflame the patriotic seelings of
his countrymen, and contribute to the instruction and entertainment
of the world at large. Livy generally looks at a ilistorical event or
character from a moral point of view: he wishes to excite our admi-
ration ofthe great, love of the good, and hatred of the bad ; he feels
a proud pleasure in describing the power of the Romans, or the
purity of manners by which they were at first distinguished3 and
the history of the early ages of the state seems to have consoled
him for the wickedness and wretchedness which he had seen and
felt during the time of the civil wars, when the republic was over-
thrown. In consequence of such feelings, he was in principle a
republican3 but, restrained by law and habit, he was a decided
conservative, and therefore could not look without sorrow even upon
the happy results which had followed the dictator Caesar’s dem'o-
lition of the antiquated aristocratic constitution of the republic. It
was on this ground that Augustus reproachfully called him a Poni-
peian, without, however, withdrawing from him his esteem and
favour.* This conservatism, and habitual admiration of the oldeu
times above the modern, merely because they were the olden times,
are exhibited by Livy in the early parts of his work, especially in
his description of the contests between the patricians and the ple-
, beians —that is, particularly in books ii.——vi. Livy's partiality to
the patricians in this part of the history may be blamed with more
justice than his liking for Pompey, the defendet· of the old republic
against the monarchy which Caesar was threatening. His con-
servatism‚ however, never led him to wink at cruelty or baseness‚
or to conceal or mis-state facts. History‚ as he obtained it from
the various sources to which he resoned, was to him a sacred thing.
He was by no means a searcher into history, though he does not
scruple, on occasion, to tell his readers of his assiduity in this
respect. For a thorough inquisition into historical points he was
naturally unfitted, being possessed neither of the restless activity
osa Cato nor of the deep antiquarian spirit ofa Varro. His sources
were not. the documents of the olden time, which were preserved in
the Italian cities‚ among those‘tribes which are now extinct, but the
works of the Roman annalists, Fabius Pictor, M. Cato, Calpurnius
Piso, Sempronius Tuditanus, Cn. Gellius, Valerius Antias. and
Licinius Macer. From these he chose his materials, and their diver-
sities of statement he endeavoured to settle, exercising indeed the
judgment osa man of sense, but no strict aud independetit criticism.
Whatever presented itself to him as a correct statement of a fact,
he received, even though doubts of its truth might arise. To this
we must attribute his mention every year of the prodigies which
hadv been reported and set down in the annals ofthe pontifex maximus.

vanter¹ ad Poenum venerunt, capti donis cum bona pace

exercitum per fines suos praeter Ruscinonem oppidum trans-
miserunt.

25. [n ltaliam interim nihil ultra quam Iberum transisse
Hannibalem a Massiliensium legatis Romam² perlatum
erat, cuin perinde ac si Alpes jam transisset, Boii sollicitatis
Insubribus defecerunt? nec tam ob veteres in populum
Romanum iras, quarn quod nuper⁴ circa Padum Placen-
tiam Cremonamque colonias in agrurn Gallicum deductas
aegre patiebantur. Itaque armis repente arreptis, in eum
ipsum agrum impetu sacto tantum terroris ac tumultus
fecerunt, ut non agrestis modo multitudo sed ipsi triumviri
Romani, qui ad agrum venerant assignandum, diffisi Pla-
centiae moenibus, Mutinam5 confugerint, C. Lutatius, C.
Servilius, T. Annius. -Lutatii nomen haud dub um est :⁸
pro C. Servilio et T. Annio Q. Acilium et C. Herennium

¹ So the manuscripts read, the editions commonly gravate. But
both forms are according to analogy, and besides them we have an·
other, gravatim. with the same sense.

² ⁴ To Rome‚' defining more precisely what we are to understand
by iri-Italiam. Compare in the preceding chapter Galli—aliquot
Ῥοξιιιέιε. to cum with the indicative, see Gram. ὖ 355.

⁴ In the previous year two Latin colonicas, each consisting os 6000
men. had been settled in the country on the Po, which had been
given up by the Gauls to the Romans. The places chosen sor the
colonies were Placentia (now PiacenzaL on this side of the Po, at
the place where the Trebia falls into it ; and Cremona, on the other
side of the river, and some miles sarther down. 'l'hese were two
important fortresses, by which then and afterwards the Roman pos-
sessions in the province of Cisalpine Gaul were principally 'protected.
For the seulement of the colonies sent out frorn Rome—that is, for
the assignment of the portions of land, the superintending of the
building and fortisying of the town, and the regulation of internal
arrangements—some distinguished men were chosen by the Roman
peorsse, and invested with military command for< several years.
Their number was commonly three, the smallest which could con·
stitute a college3 and sor this reason they are generally called in
Latin tresviri coloniae deducendae.- one of them is called triumvir—-
that is, one of the commission of three; and if anywhere in the
manuscripts we find triumviri in letters, not ΙΙ] viri, this form of
the plural can be explained only by an ungrammatical formation
directly from the singular. Compare Zumpt, ᾗ 124.

⁵ Mutina is the modern Modena, south-east from Piacenza, on the
road to Bononia (Bologna) and Ariminum (Rimini), where Italy
Pro er be an.

⁶ ”il'his rffan had already been consul in the year 220, but in con-
sequence of an iuformality in his electiori, had laid down his office.
He may have been chosen a triumvir coloniae deducendae, as a sort
of compensation sor his loss.

192 T. Livii.

9. Cum diu anceps suisset certamen, et Saguntinis, quia
praeter spem resisterent, crevissent animi, Poenus, quia non
vicisset, pro victo esset, clamorem repente oppidani tollunt,
hostemque in ruinas muri expellunt, inde impeditum trepi-
dantemque exturbant, postremo fusum fugatumque in castra
redigunt.¹

Interim ab Roma² legatos venisse nuntiatum est; quibus
obviam ad mare missi ab Hannibale qui dicerent nec tuto
eos adituros inter 101³ tam efferatarum gentium arma, nec
Hannibali in tanto discrimine rernm operae esse⁴ legationes
audire. Apparebat non admissos Carthaginem protinus
ituros. Litteras igitur nuntiosque ad principes factionis
Barcinae praemittit, ut praepararent suorum animos, ne quid
pars altera gratificari pro Romanis posset.⁵

10. Itaque, praeterquam quod admissi auditique sunt, ea
quoque vana atque irrita legatio suit. Hanno unus adverso
senatu causam foederis, magno silentio propter auctoritatem
suam, non cum assensu audientium egit.⁶ Per deos foederum
arbitros ac testes monuisse, praedixisse se⁷ ne Hamilcaris
progeniem ad exercitum mitterent. Non manes, non stirpem
ejus conquiescere viri3 nec unquam, donec sanguinis nominv

himself undefended to all subsequent volleys. It is worthy of re
mark that in this sentence orma is used as equivalent to ‘shigld
Indeed this is its proper signification, arma being opposed, as '‘de
sensive arms,' to tela, ¹offensive.’

’ Three successful efforts of the Saguntines‚ after maintaining for
a long time a firm resistance‚ are distinguished: first, they forced
the Cartliaginians out of the space between the town and the wall;
seeondly, they drove them also from the breach, where they were
standing irresolutely, not having room to extend their forces3 and
thirdly, chased them back into their own camp.

² Ab Roma for the simple ablative. See Gram. <> 307, 3, note 1.

⁸ A more common mode of expression would be inter tot tamque
efferatarum, the conjunction being added in the same manner as with
multi. See Zumpt, <> 756.

⁴ Operae mihi nou est, ‘it is not my business3' therefore :non
vocat mihi, ‘I have not time for it;’ also=non est operae pretium,
⁴ it is not worth the trouble.’

⁶ ‘That the other party might not be able to do anything in favour
of the Romans? Commonly we say gratificor tibi aliquid, ‘ Ι do
you a favour;' but here we have pro Romanis instead of the dative.

⁶ ‘Hanno alone, the senate being opposed to him, pleaded the
cause of the Roman treaty’ (that is, spoke in support ofit). ‘ whilst
his hearers maintained deep silence‚ but did notassent to his views.’
The manuscripts have cum assensu, which is plainly false. for mm
is necessary. We may either, however, read non cnm assensu, or,
omitting the cum, non asseras-14, for the mere ablative also can be used.

X UNTRODL‘CTION

Implicit belief 10 111656 was a cliaiacteristic feature of the early ages,
but a sensible and active· ininded historiari would have passed them
over with silent contempt. A doubt of the truth of the early 1115·
tory of Rome, according to the ordinary traditions‚ seems never to
have occurred to him. The first sketch of great events in Roman
history by a cotemporary was made so late as the Punic wars, · and
the history 011116 kings and of the early ages of the rep ublic. rest-
ing merely on oral tradition and popular belief, was grossly falsified
through the conviction entertained by the Romans of their invinci-
bility and (1161110655131111115 prejudice Livy was as much enchained
as his 0161166655015,111611110011515.’11115 part 01 1115 history, and
indeed the history of Rome 10 general, have therefore afforded to
acute critics rich fiel ds 101· conjectures and corrections. Livy’s
great desire seems to be, to bring out clearly what he considers to
be the characteristics of great and leading men. For this end the
speeches which he puts in the mouths of statesmen and generals
are particularly 056101. According to the judgment of antiquity, he
displays in these orations at once considerable insight into the cha-
racters ot public men and political measures, and a remarkable
power 01 eloquent and vigorous expression. * It must here be
observed, however, that 111 1116 early periods Livy does n'ot give
way 10 1115 liking f'or speech· making. In this respect he 15 very
favourably distinuuished from the Greek historiam, Dionysius ofHali-
6010115505, who makes Romulus and Numa deliver long harangues‚
exhibiting all the art and skill of the most polished rhetoric, and
who thereby shows to his readers merely his own want of discreet-
.ness. Far from attributing such absurdity to Livy, we say this 111 V
his praise, that even when he leaves the mists which envelop the
history of the first three centuries‚ he imposes considerable restraint
upon his oratory. He brings out in his speeches the political crecds
of statesmen as gathered from their actions3 and it is indubitable
that, in alt cases where it was possible, 116, like Sallust and Tacitus,
6005011611 1116 actual published orations 01 111656 0160, and founding
his own upon 1116115, endeavoured also to give as much as possible
oftheir style and turn 01 thought.

Livy made 056 of the 11 01115 of such Greeks as 11 rote on Roman
history or events connected 111111 11. Ρο11111105, 10 particular, was
his great authority for the history ol' the period from the outbreak
of the second Punic war, 218 nc, till the destruction of Corinth
and Carthago, 146 B. 6. In al ll the great transactione 01 that 106010-
rable and 6116111111 period, Livy (161160 ded principally 00 him, 001,
however, without trequently amplil'ying details from Roman annal-
1515, and sometimes, 111 cases 01 discrep· incy, preferring the authority

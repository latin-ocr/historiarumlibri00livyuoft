omnium quae post se agerentur ex saltu evasere, et cum in
tumulo quodam constitissent, clamorem modo ac sonum
armorum audientes, quae fortuna pugnae esset neque scire
nec perspicere prae caligine poterant. Inclinata denique re,
curn incalescente sole dispulsa nebula aperuisset diem, tum
liquida jarn luce montes campique perditas res stratamque
ostendere foede Romanam aciem. Itaque ne in conspectos
procul immitteretur eques, sublatis raptim signis, quam cita·
tissimo poterant agmine, sese abripuerunt.¹ Postero die,
cum super cetera extrema fames etiarn instaret, fidem dante
Maharbale, qui eum omnibus equestribus copiis nocte conse·
cutus erat, si arma tradidissent, abire cum singulis vesti·
mentis passurum, sese dediderunt. Quae Punica religione²
servata fides ab Hannibale est, atque in vincula omnes
conjecit.

7. Haec est nobilis ad Trasimenum pugna atque inter
paucas³ memorata populi Romani clades. Quindecim milia
Romanorum in acie caesa sunt, decem milia sparsa fuga

er omnem Etruriam aversis itineribus⁴ urbem petiere.
illiue quingenti hostiurn in acie, multi postea ex vulneribus
periere. Multiplex⁵ caedes utrimque facta traditur ab aliis:
ego praeterquam quod nihil auctum ex vano velim, quo
nimis inclinant ferme scribentium animi, Fabium⁶ aequalem
temporibus hujusce belli potissimum auctorem habui. Han-

 

¹ This must have happened on the road to Perusia.

² ‘ With Punic faith,' which, in the opinion of the Romans, was
equivalent to none at all. The atque in the next clause is not with-
out its emphatic meaning. Compare Zumpt, ὑ 333, middle.

⁸ Inter pamm, as, α (according to the gender of the substantive),
is nothing else than a periphrasis for the superlative, :imprimis,
‘highly‚ remarkably’—literally, ‘among few;’ that is, ‘so very
high, as to have but few equals, few standing around it.’ The ex-
pression here is by no means an assertion that the Romans sus-
‘tained few defeats, but few as disastrous as that at Trasimene. We
say homo inter paucos disertus, ‘ a man possessed of eloquence such
as few attain to.‘—-DIemorata= memorabilis, ‘mentioned,’ for
¹ worthy of mention, memorable,‘ a natural enough use of the past
participle. Compare Zumpt, ᾗ 328, middle. ,

⁴ ‘ By by-roads,' sor, as may easrly be conceived, the enemy was
in hot pursuit along the direct roads. The reading of the editions
here is diversis, but this is an unnecessary change.

⁶ ‘Many times greater,' for multiplex, properly merely ‘mani-
fold,’ has sometimes this additional meaning: as, for instance, in
vii. 8, multi lez quam pro numero damnum est.

⁶ Fabius {ictor is meant, and Livy alludes not to his great his-
torical work, entitled ‘Annales,' which comprehended the more
ancient history of Rome, but to his Greek work, Ἀπομνημονεύματα,
Memorabilia, being an account of the memorahle events which had

happened during his own lifetime.

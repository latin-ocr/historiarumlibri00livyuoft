pueros exponunt. Vastae tum iniis locis solitudines erant.
Tenet fama,¹ cum fluitantem alveum, quo expositi erant
pueri, tenuis in sicco aqua destituisset, lupam sitientem ex
montibus, qui circa sunt, ad puerilem vagitum cursum flex-
isse3 eam summissas infantibus adeo mitem praebuisse mam-
mas, ut lingua lambentem pueros magister regii pecoris in-
venerit. Faustulo fuisse nomen ferunt. Ab eo ad stabula
Larentiae uxori educandos latos. Sunt qui Larentiam vul-
gato corpore lupam inter pastores vocatam putent, inde locum
fabulae ac miraculo datum.2 Ita geniti itaque educati, cum
primum adolevit aetaS, nec in stabulis nec ad pecora segnes
venando peragrare saltus. Hinc robore corporibus animisque
sumpto, jam non seras tantum subsistere, sed³ in latrones
praeda onustos impetus facere, pastoribusque rapta dividere,
etcum his, crescente in dies grege juvenum, seria ac jocos
celebrare.

5. Jam tum in Palatio monte Lupercal hoc4 fuisse ludi-
crum ferunt, et a Pallanteo, urbe Arcadica, Pallantium, dein=
Palatium montem appellatum. Ibi Evandrum, qui ex eo
genere Arcadum multis ante tempestatibus⁵ tenuerit loca, ¹
sollemne allatum ex Arcadia instituisse, ut nudi juvenes

 

at the Comitium, was originally called Romularis‚ and afterwards,
by a change of p1·on0nnciati0n‚ Ruminalis. The more correct view
is, that ruminalis is derived from rumen, ruminis—that is, mamma.

¹ Fama tenet or obtinet, ‘the story is preserved.’ We may either
regard the verb as used intransitively, or, iftransitively‚ supply se,
or give the following sentence as its object. Compare ii. 3, per ali-
quot dies ea consultatio tenuit, ‘continued 3⁷ see also note, xxi. 46.
The story was preserved by means of a monument exhibiting a
she-wolf suckling two boys, which was erected on the spot, and of
which we still have copies.

² A very profane explanation of the popular story. A much more
natural interpretation is afforded by the fact, that the wolf was be-
lieved to be the animal sacred to Mars.

³ The omission of etiam with secl after mm modo, non solum, non
tantum, is very common in Livy. See Zumpt, ᾗ 7:24.

⁴ Ηοε means ‘the festival which on the day of the Lupercalia (Fe-
bruary l5th iu the Julian Calendar) is still kept up.’ This old
Italian festival of the shepherds, in which a dog was solemnly
slaughtered‚ and Luperci ran half naked round the Palatium, was
connected, as in the text, with the pastoral character of the founders
of Rome.

⁵ ‘ A lons,r time before‚’ or many ages before! Tempestas is here
used simply sor tempus, perhaps for the sake of effect. At least
tempestas, being an old, and, in this sense, properly a poenieat word,
is calculated to lead our minds back to the pastoral district of -Ar-
cadia, and to times long gone by; for Evander lived three genera-
tions before Aeneas and the destruction of Troy.

Lmen xxi. 251

facinora, tum, ut alia vetustate abolevissent‚¹ ob recentem
Boiorum perfidiam. Sempronius contra continendis in fide
sociis maximum vinculum esse primos qui eguissent ope
defensos censebat.2 Tum collega cunctante equitatum suum,
mille peditum, jaculatoribus ferme admixtis, ad defenden-
dum Gallicum agrum trans Trebiam mittit. Sparsos et
incompositos, ad hoc graves praeda plerosque⁷ cum inopi-
natos invasissent, ingentem terrorem caedemque ac fugam
usqne ad castra stationesque hostium fecere; unde multi-
tudine effusa pulsi rursus subsidio suorum proelium resti-
tuere. Varia inde pugna cedentes sequentesque cum ad
extremum aequassent certamen, major tamen quam hostium
Romanis sama victoriae fuit.³

53. Ceterum nemini omnium major justiorque quam ipsi
consuli videri: gaudio efferri‚·¹ qua parte copiarum alter
consul victus foret, ea se vicisse. Restitutos ac refectos
militibus animos3 nec quemquam esse praeter collegam
qui dilatam dimicationem vellet: eum auimo magis quam
corpore aegrum memoria vulneris aciem ac tela horrere.
Sed non esse cum aegro senescendum. Quid enim ultra
differri aut teri tempus? quem tertium consulem, quem
alium exercitum expectari? Castra Carthaginiensium in
Italia ac prope in conspectu urbis esse. Non Siciliam ac
Sardiniam victis ademptas, nec cis Iberum Hispaniam peti,
sed solo patrio terraque, in qua geniti forent, pelli Romanos.
‘Quantum iirgemiscant,’ inquit, ‘patres nostri circa moenia

¹ ‘Even granting that other things had, from length of time.
perished from memor-y ;’ from abolescere, ⁴ to perish, vanish, decay.’
Another reading is obsolevissent‚ which is said ofthings that go out
of use: and is less suitable, therefore, here. As to the transitive
and intransitive forms of the verbs of this root, see Zumpt, ᾖ 174.

ξ ‘ He thought that the defence ofthe first who had needed assist-
ance was the strongest bond sor keeping the allies true to their
agreement! The latter part (‘for keeping,’ διο.) is expressed by
the dative of the gerundive, as frequentl . As to the use of the
participle in primos defensos as a verba substantive, see Gram.

³ ‘ The Romans had a greater fame of being victorious than that
of the enemy was3' that is, the majority of people considered the
Romans to have gained the victory. We have inserted quam, follow-
ing other critics.

⁴ According to his usual practice, Livy gives himself sull swing
in the description of the consul’s state of mind, and sor this the
historical infinitive is most suitable. Victussoret, though no doubt
:victus esset, is yet but rarely used with such a time as it has
here, having commonly a reference to the future. See Gram. ὓ 137,
note 4, and Zumpt, ᾧ 156, note, sub fin.

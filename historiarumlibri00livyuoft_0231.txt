LJBER xxr. 217

28. Galli occursant in npam cum variis ululatibus can-
tuque moris sui, quatientes scuta super capita vibrantes-
que dextris tela, quamquam ex adverso terrebat tanta vis
navium cum ingenti sono fluminis et clamore vario nau-
tarum, militum, et qui nitebantur perrumpere impetum
fluminis, et qui ex altera ripa trajicientes suos hortabantur.¹
Jam satis paventes adverso tumultu² terribilior ab tergo
adortus clamor, castris ab Hannone captis. Mox et ipse
aderat, ancepsque terror circumstabat, et e navibus tanta
vi armatorum in terram evadente, et ab tergo improvisa
premente acie. Galli postquam utroque vim facere conati³
pellebantur, qua patere visum maxime iter, perrumpunt,
trepidique in vicos passim suos diffugiunt. Hannibal ceteris
copiis per otium trajectis, spernens jam Gallicos tumultus·¹
castra locat.

Elephantorum trajiciendorum varia consilia fuisse credo:
certe variata memoria actae rei. Quidam congregatis ad,
ripam elephantis tradunt ferocissimum ex iis irritatum ab
rectore suo, cum refugientem in aquarn nantem sequeretur‚⁵
traxisse gregem, ut quemque timentem altitudinem desti-
tueret vadum, impetu ipso fluminis in alteram ripam rapi-
ente.⁶ Ceterum magis constat ratibus trajectos: id ut tutius

 

¹ A vivid picture. The Gauls were terrified at the noisy approach
of the ships, and by the various shouts of the enemy3 both those
who were actually crossing and battling with the current, and those
who were still standing on the western bank, and encouraging their
companions in the boats. Observe the asyndeton nautarum, militum,
which helps to give life to the picture. See Zumpt, ᾗ 783, middle.

² ‘ By the tumult in front.’ Adortus, with the omission of est.- ‘ a
still more alarming shout assailed them from behind.’

³ ‘ After the Gauls, having attempted a vigorous resistance on both
sides (that is, against those who were crossing the river. and against
Hanno in their rear), were driven back, they broke through by
whatever road presented itself as most open.⁷ As to the form utro-
ques see Zumpt, ὓ 289, and as to passim, Gram. ᾗ 221. Passim
means ‘ scattered‚ in a scattered manner ς’ that is, ⁴ in many' or ‘ all
places,’ but not ⁴ in some few places,' or ‘here and there.’

⁴ Hannibal despised after this the noisy and threatening but brief
risings of the Gauls in arms. This was the view of the Romans,
who had osten experienced Gallie assaults (properly expressed by
the word tumultus), and had learned, that if they were quietly but
undauntedly resisted, they were truly contemptible.

⁵ ‘ As it followed the keeper‚ who fled into the water swirnming,‘
qui nans in aquam refugiebat. The participle mms is retained, even
though the qni refugiebat is also put into a participial form.

⁶ ‘ Whilst the current itself carried all who, though afraid of the
deep water, were deserted by the firm ground, over to the other
side.’ Ut quemque destitueret vadum means literally ‘just as the

ground tllgsgrted each‚⁷ but this is=om71es quos vadum destitueret.-

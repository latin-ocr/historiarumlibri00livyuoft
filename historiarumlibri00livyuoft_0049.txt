Linea 1. 35

¹ Wars between Rome and Fidenae are frequently mentioned in
the early books of Livy. These came to a close, however, in the
year 426 B. c. (Livy, iv. 34), when the Fidenates were subdued, and
their city destroyed. After this, we hear of Fidenae only as an in·
significant village. lt was situated about six miles from Rome. near
the junction of the Anio and Tibcr. It was principally inhabited
by Etruscam, and was in constant alliance with the wealthy and
powersul Etruscan city of Veii, situated very near the Roman
territory.

² That is, a Roman mile ; sor a passus equalled five Roman feet,
being as much as a man could span with his legs emended. Mille
passus might have been used instead of mille passuum.

³The explanation of these words is difficolt. If nothing is al-
tered, the translation is, ⁶ he ordered apart of his soldiers to lie down
in ambush in dark (shadowy) places round about thick ovet-grown
brushwood.’ We might correct thus, locis circa denso obsitis vir-
gult05 ‘in places darkened all around about by being overgrown
with thick brushwood.‘ Livy uses only the soi-m virgultum of the
second declension, not virgulta of the first3 otherwise the only
change necessary would have been obsita into obsitis, thus putting
densa virgulta in the ablative singular. The conjectural reading
iocis circa denso obsitis virgulto et obscuris is decidedly to be approved
of so far as regards the sense, but varies too far from the manuscripts.

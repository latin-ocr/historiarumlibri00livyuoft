¹ The principal part os Hannibal‘s plan, therefore, was ιο provoke
the Romans to war b besieging Saguntum. He intended, how·
ever, first to subdue tile other Spanish tribes beyond the Iberus,
partly in order to strengthen the Carthaginian dominion in Spain,
partly to make it appear as if he had not from the beginning had his
eye upon Saguntum, but was led to it in regular order (rerum serie),
after subduing the neighbouring tribes, ‘ by the desire of adding the
Saguntines ιο them.' This must be the sense os jun endo. though
it cannot be deuied that the word does not recommen itselfas par-
cularly suitable sor the expression of this idea.

'³ This is the name which Polybius gives to the chief town of the
Olcades: in the ordinary editions of Livy the reading is Carteiam,
with many variations‚ however. in the manuscripts. Neither the
tribe ofthe Olcades nor the name ostheir capital is elsewhere men-
tioned: the historically-known place called Carteia was situated
near Gades (Cadiz), and consequently quite away from the quarter
comprehended in Hannibal’s plan.

³ Ἀ war contribution having been imposed upon them.’ Com-
monly ablatives absolute are only so used that the subject of the
main verb is to be understood as agent ; for instance, Carthaginien-
ses, stipendio imposito, civitatem in dicionem receperunt, ‘ after a con-
tribution had been imposed by them.¹ Sometimes, however, cases
occur, as here, where to the ablative absolute the subject of the
main verb is the object.

⁴ The modern Carthagena on the Medherranean, situated between
and about equidistant from Valencia on the east, and Malaga on the
west—a foundation of the Carthaginians, and the capital of their
province in Spain. ’

⁵ The Vaccaei were a tribe in the northern part of Spain, about
equidistant from the two oceans. Their chief town was called Pa-
ssntiffi now Palencia, to the north of the river Durius (Duoro or

uero).

⁰ A considerable tribe on the Tagus (Tajo) and Anas (Gaudiana).
Its chief town was Toletum (Toledo).

PREFACE. V

the Paris Library3 and upon a ‘Codex Mediceus, at Florence‚
different from that which contains the first decade. Ever since
these or similar manuscripts, now lost, were made use os by· the
early editors, the text of Livy has by degrees been greatly im-
proved both in regard to completeness and accuracy. As, how-
ever, even the best manuscripts are disfigured by numerous and
varied errors, the textos our author presented, and still presents
to the learned, a rich field sor the exercise and display os their
knowledge, both of history and of languagestn acute conjectures!
The great edition os Livy, into which all the discoveries and cor-
rections made previous to the time of its publication (1738-46)
were incorporated, is that of Arnold Drakenborch. There are
in it, besides the careful and excellent notes of Drakenborch him-
sels, the remarks of the former critics, particularly C. Sigonius
and J. F. Gronow (Gronovius). A part os the work, too, is occu-
’ pied by the supplements of John Freinsheim. These were
intended to supply the place of the lost books of Livy, and were
composed in Latin, according to those epitomae of all the books
which have come down to us under the name of the historiari
Florus, the materials being collected with unconnnon diligence
from other ancient writers. During the century which has
elapsed since the publication of Drakenb01·ch·s most meritorious
edition, very many corrections of the text of Livy have been
made by modern critics, such as Stroth, walch, Kreyssig, Bekker,
and Alschefski.

⁴² In some manuscripts os the first decade, particularly in the ‘Codex Medi·
ceuS,' there is subscribed at the end of each book, ⁶ l, Nicomachus have at
Henna (in Sicily) corrected (emendat-i) these books according to an older copy)
ln all probability this Nicomachus lived about the end of the fourth century
aster Christ. Resides this note there is added, · 1, Victorianus, have corrected
(emendabam) these books for the domini Symmachi· (a father and son, who flou-
rished about thr: year 400 aster Christ). 'l'liough these notes have come into
the existing manuscripts only by transcription si-oni the more ancient one.
still they give us sufficieutly certain evidence ofthe fact that the text was cor-
rected. Einendation, before the invention of printing, uas in the highest
degree necessary, and was effectes! either by professed grannnarians, or at least
by nien of learning, the mere transcription being execntesl by scribes or cal—
ligraphers, who worked mechanically. without trouhling their hrains about
what they were writing. A manuscript which had not been correcta-d was of
course disfigured hy inany lapsus os the copyist. even though lie had faithfully
followed his original„ or at least had not intentionally divergcd from it. The
celebrated ‘Codex Puteanus· is a manuscript of this kind, beautifully written.
but not revised by a learned reader- lt is therefore justly considered to be
faithful. but at the same time hy no means free from errors.

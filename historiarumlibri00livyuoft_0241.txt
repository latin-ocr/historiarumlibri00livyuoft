inter montana, populum.¹ Ibi non bello apertO‚ sed suis
artibus, fraude et insidiis est prope circumventus.² Magno
natu³ principes castellorum oratores ad Poenum veniunt,
alienis malis, utili exemplo, doctos memorantes⁴ amicitiam
malle quam vim experiri Poenorum: itaque obedienter
imperata facturos3 commeatum itinerisque duces et ad
fidem promissorum obsides acciperet.⁵ Hannibal nec temere
credendum nec aspernandos ratus, ne repudiati aperte hostes
fierent, benigne cum respondisset, obsidibus quos dabant
acceptis‚⁶ et commeatu quem in viam ipsi detulerant usus,
nequaquam ut inter pacatos, composito agmine duces eorum
sequitur.⁷ Primum agmen elephanti et equites erant3 ipse
post cum robore peditum, circumspectans sollicitusque
omnia‚⁸ incedebat. Ubi in angustiorem viam et parte altera
subjectam jugo insuper imminenti⁹ ventum est, undique ex
insidiis barbari a fronte ab tergo coorti comminus eminus
petunt,¹⁰ saxa ingentia in agmen devolvunt. Maxima ab
tergo vis hominum urgebat. .In eos versa peditum acies
haud dubium fecit, quin, nisi firmata extrema agminis

¹ ‘ A people abounding in agriculturists,’ where populus is evi-
dently used for the ‘district2' and in reference to this application
of the word we have ut inter montana, which ‚limits the assertion
of 'mulltitudei ‘so far as mountainous districts can have many
agricu turtsts.

² Circumvenireu ¹ to overreach‚ overcome.’ When the success is
gained by open violence, opprimere is the more suitable word.

³ Magno natu, ¹ of great age, aged.’ See Zumpt, ὖ 670.

⁵ ‘For the security of their promises (that is, in order that he
giighct} placi} {ogfidence in their promises) he might take hostages.’
»aee Tam. l .

⁵ ‘After he had accepted the hostages whom they offered ;’ that
ss, after he had stated that he would accept them; for that the bar-
barians did not actually give hostages, appears from their subse-
quent attack, and also in the language, from the use of the imperfect
dabant. Compare page 225, note 3.

⁷ ‘ He follows their guides with the army in regular marching
order, and by no means as if he were in a friendly country! If
ineam osito be read, as in other editions, then nequaquam must be
joine with it, and not with the subsidiary clause.

Β The accusative omnia belongs to circumspectans, or at least is
influenced by it ; for sollicitus omnia would be an unusual construc-
tion. ⁴

⁹ ‘ Which on the one side ran under a mountain ridge, that hung
over it‚¹ or we may say, ‘which was commanded by a ridges

¹⁰ ‘ They attack.’ or ‘ made an attack,’ used absolutely for impetum
ζαξὸἱὲηι. Comminus eminus without a conjunction. See Zumpt,

tumque oppidum ea ruina crediderant Poeni 3 qua,¹ velut
si pariter utrosque murus texisset, ita utrimque in pugnam
procursum est. Nihil tumultuariae pugnae simile erat,
quales in oppugnationibus urbium per occasionem partis
alterius² conciri solent: sed justae acies,‘³ velut patenti
campo, inter ruinas muri tectaque urbis modico distantia
intervallo constiterant. Hinc speS, hinc desperatio animos
irritat, Poeno cepisse jam se urbem. si paululum annitatur,
credente, Saguntinis pro nudata moenibus patria corpora.
opponentibus, nec ullo pedem referente, ne in relictum a
se locum hostem immitteret. Itaque quo acrius et conserti
magis utrimque pugnabant, eo plures vulnerabantur, nullo

in pilo, quadratum⁶ stuppa circumligabant liniebautque pice.
Ferrum autem tres longum habebat pedes, ut cum armis
transfigere corpus posset. Sed id maxime, etiamsi haesisset

multo majorem ignem ferret, arma omitti cogebat, nudumque
militem ad insequentes ictus praebebat.³

¹ Qua, scil. ruina: ‘upon this fall both sides rushed forward to
battle.' The Carthaginians, who thought the. city as good as already
ὶαῑῐεηι, had now a very severe hand-to-hand conflict to sustain in the
reac‘l. ,
² ⁴ By a savourable opportunity offering itself to the one party or
the other.’ Alter, properly ‘the one,' has not unfrequently the sense
os alteruter, ¹ the one or the other.’
³ Justae acies are armies drawn up in regular order, in opposition
to tumultuariae monus, bands of men without any order.

⁵ ⁴ With a beechen shaft, which was otherwise round. The sin-
gular of the common plural ceteri is rare. It does occur sometimes,
however. except the nominative ceter-us. Sallust expresses himself
in a manner similar to this, Jugurtha, chap. 89: Capsenses nna modo
—jugi aqua, cetera pluvia utebantur, ‘ made use of only one running
water, otherwise of rain.' ln the ordinary editions of Livy, the
present passage is given with cetera, a Greek accusative of refer-
ence, instead of cetero, agreeing with hastili. Cetera. however, is
found in all the manuscripts, and can be very well defended.

they rolled round with oakum.'

alarmed at the fite, and threw the buckler away, thereby exposing

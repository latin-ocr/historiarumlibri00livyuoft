ortus et comploratio sui patriaeque fregere tandem virum.
Complexus inde suos ‹limittit; ipse retro ab urbe castra
movit. Abductis deinde legionibus ex agro Romano, invidia.

aetate usurpasse vocem, multo miserius seni exilium esse.
Non inviderunt laude sua² mulieribus viri Romani: adeo
sine obtrectatione gloriae alienae vivebatur. Monumento
quoque quod esset, templum Fortunae muliebri aedificatum
dedicatumque est.³

Rediere deinde 'Volsci adjunctis Aequis in agrum Roma-

Hinc ex certamine, Volsci Aequine imperatorem conjuncto

disgracefnl in you than unfortunate for me; and as Iam very miser—
able, I shall not bc so long ;' that is, ‘it is the extreme of disgrace
togou and of miset-y to me, but I shall not endure it long! The
or inary reading is ut sim.- but as Veturia has just said that nothing
could be more unfortunate sor her, the undecided expression ut sim
-‘ granting that l am'—is unsuitable; and we prefer the reading os
the Florentine manuscript, which gives the indicative, ut sum, ‘as
1 am) De his videris, pointing to the children. ‘think on these,’ aa
to which use ofthe future perfect, see i. 57, p. 96, note 5.

¹ Translate thus, ‘in the same state'—namely, as an exul, not at
all the same as eum.

’So the manuscripts read, for laudes suas; and the construction
invideo tibi hoc re, which was used not unfrequently in the Silver
gage. is explained by the sense os invideo tibi=privo. See Gram.

³ Erected, as other writers tell us, at the fourth milestone on the
via Latina, where the conversation took place. We do not doubt
the truth of the story that the prayers os women induced the enemy
to withdraw: only this is to be remarked, that the Volsci and Aequi
retained sor a long time possession of their conquests3 so that Veli-
trae‚—in which, as has been already several times observed, there
was a Roman colony—appears henceforth as in the power of the
Yolsci, and the Latin town of Praeneste as under the Aequi. Fur-
ther, we must notice that the citics of Circeii, Cora, Norba, and
Signia, which lay more to the south, and in which we have already
seen Roman-Latin colonies settled, were now in the power of the
Volsci, and were not liberated and restored to their connection with
Rome till after many battles. The missortunes resulting frorn this
Volscian invasion were felt not by Rome only, but still rnore severely
hythe Latin league. The philosophical and sensible reader will
not allow himself-to be misled by the boastful mention, which occum
so {requentlffi of the victories gained by the Romans over the Volsci
an Aequi. ” ’ “ “ ’ ·

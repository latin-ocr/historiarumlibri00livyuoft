42. Nec jam publicis magis consiliis Servius quam privatis
munire opes* Et ne, qualis Anci liberum animus adversus
Tarquinium suerat, talis adversus se Tarquinii liberum esset,
duas filias juvenibus regiis Lucio atque Arunti Tarquinii3‚
jungit. Nec rupit tamen fati necessitatem humanis consiliis,
quin invidia regni etiam inter domesticos infida omnia atque
infesta faceret. Peropportune ad praesentis quietem status
bellum cum Veientibus (jam enim indutiae exierant) aliis-
que Etruscis sumptum.2 In eo bello et virtus et fortuna
enituit Tullii3 fusoque ingenti hostium exercitu, haud dubius
rex, sen Patrum seu plebis animos periclitaretur? Romam
rediit. Aggrediturque inde ad pacis longe maximum opus,
ut, quemadmodum Numa divini auctor juris fuisset, ita Ser-
vium conditorem omnis in civitate discriminis ordinumque,
quibus iuter gradus dignitatis fortunaeque aliquid iuter-
lucet‚⁴ posteri fama ferrent. Censum euim instituit, rem
saluberrimam tanto futuro imperi03 ex quo belli pacisque
munia uon viritim, ut ante, sed pro habitu pecuniarum
fierent.⁵ Tum classes centuriasque et hunc ordinem ex censu
descripsit,6 vel paci dec-orum vel bello.

 

¹ Consilio publica are plans or designs regardingthe state,privata,
regarding his own domestic relations. Servius strengthened his
power by the latter quite as much as the formem for by mm magis
quam the main stress is thrown upon the second member of the sen-
tence. whereas with uon minus quam the reverse is the case.

'⁶‘ ¹ Very opportuuely (that is, at a very opportune time) a war is
undem-alten,y because a foreign war usually puts a stop to intestine
commotioris. Smnimus quod praebetur, affertur ab aliis, ‘ we take
up the gage of battle.⁷

³ ⁴ Being now indubitably king. whether he put the sentiments of
the patres or the ilehs to the proof.’ The subjunctive periclitaretur
means that if he fiad tried either the one party or the other, he would
have found their sentiments in his favour, but that, as no proof was
necessary, he had tried neither.

‘² ⁴ Fouuder of the orders by which a certain interval is established
between the grades of rank and fortune! The dignitas refers to
the distinction made between the knights and those appointed to
serve on scot, thesortmza to the classes instituted by Servius, which
were ranged according to fortune. Aliquid interlucet, ‘ there is some
distinction ordiffe1·ence‚' as if there were vacant spaces between the
gradus dignitatis·fortunaeque, through which the sun shone.

⁵ Census, ‘an estimate of a fortune,’ otherwise a fortune itself.
Mania, ‘duties3’ that is, what each person had to do or to pay.
This entire alteration of rhesystem according to which these duties
were performed, and the privileges dependent upon them were be-
stowed. is regarded by Livy as a very salutary measure, consider-
ing the greatness to which the state was afterwards to attain. He
believes the aristocracy of weahh, which was one main element in
the classes of Servius, to be a strong bulwark against democratia
licentiousness.

⁶ ¹ He marked out the order which still exists‚’ or ‘is still preserved.'

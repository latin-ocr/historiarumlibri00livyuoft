omni plebe adversante, quae primo coeperat fastidire¹ munus
vulgatum a civibus esse in socios, saepe deinde et Verginium
consulem in contionibus velut vaticinantem audiebat, pes—
tilens collegae munus esse, agros illos servitutem iis, qui
acceperint, laturos, regno viam fieri. Quid i1a² enirn assumi
socios et nomen Latinum? Quid attinuisse Hernicis, paulo
ante hostibus, capti agri partem tertiam reddi, nisi ut hae
gentes pro Coriolano ducem⁸ Cassium habeant? Popularis
jam esse dissuasor et intercessor legis agrariae coeperat.
Uterque deinde consul certatim plebi indulgere. Verginius
dicere passurum se assignari agros, dum ne cui nisi civi
Romano assignentur. Cassius, quia in agraria largitione
ambitiosus in socios eoque civibus vilior⁴ erat, ut alio munere
sibi reconciliaret civium animos, jubere pro Siculo frumento
pecuniam acceptam retribui populo. Id vero haud secus
quam praesentem⁵ mercedem regni aspernata plebes: adeo
propter suspicionem insitam regni, velut abundarent omnia,
munera ejus in animis hominum respuebantur. Quem, ubi
primum magistratu abiit, damnatum necatumque constat.
Sunt qui patrem auctorem ejus supplicii ferant: eum cog-
nita domi causa verberasse ac necasse, peculiumque⁶ filii
Cereri eonsecravisse3 signum inde factum esse, et inscriptum
‘Ex Cassia familia datum.7 Invenio apud quosdam, idque
propius fidem est, a quaestoribus⁷ Κ. Fabio et L. Valerio diem

 

¹ Fastidire commonly means with the accusative, ‘to scorn a
thing‚’ but here with a dependent accusative and infinitive, ‘to be
chagrined that.’ Vulgarezcommune facere, as above, chap. 29, p.
134. note 4. An avaricious man thinks that he is unjustly deprived
of a part of whatever he has to share with another.

² Quid- ica, ‘ why, or how so 2⁷ is often used in the direct speech
for rur, and pflsses into the indirect with the same sense.

³ The manuscripts have partly ducem, partly duce. Either is good
enough, but as the Latins and Hernicians have not had Coriolanus
as a leader, ducem Cassium appears the preferable reading, and pro
Coriolano must be taken thus, ‘instead of a Coriolanus!

⁴ ⁴ Courteous to the allies, and therefore less regarded among the
citizens :' ambitiosus. properly, ‘ favour-seeking.' Siculum, ⁵ bought.
in Sicily) See chap. 34.

⁵ ⁴ Paid down,' as repraesentare pecuniam, ‘to pay ready money.’

⁶ This was the name given to the fortune of a child so long as it
remained in the power (in potestate) of the father; that is to say, in
ordinary cases, so long as the father lived3 for unless a child was
sorrnally emancipated—-as happened, for instance, to a daughter
when she married—it remained subject to its father so long as he
lihved. This was the case even when a son obtained a high office in
t e state.

⁷ Quum-rores here are in all probability the same who are elsewhere
called szesstures, commissioners appointed to investigate a crime.
As to perduellio, see i. 26, p. 52, note 5: high treason against the
republic‚ however, is properly called crimen majestatis.

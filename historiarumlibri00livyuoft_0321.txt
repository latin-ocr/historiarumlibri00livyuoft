32. Consules Atilius Fabiano, Geminus Servilius Minu-
clano exercitu accepto, hibernaculis mamre communitis (me-
dium² autumni erat) Fabii artibus cum summa inter se con-
cordia bellurn gesserunt. Frumentaturn exeunti Hannibali
diversis locis opportuni³ aderant, carpentes agmen pala-
tosque excipientes. ln casum universae dimicationis, quam
omnibus artibus petebat hostis, non veniebant. Adeoque
inopiae est coactus Hannibal,⁴ ut nisi turn fugae speciem
abeundo timuisset, Galliam repetiturus fuerit,⁵ nulla relicta
spe alendi exercitus in eis locis, si insequentes consules eis-
dem artibus bellum gererent.

Cum ad Geronium jam hieme impediente constitisset
bellum, Neapolitani legati Romam venere. Ab iis quadra-
ginta paterae aureae magni ponderis in curiam illatae, atque
ita verba sacta ut dicerent, scire sese populi aerarium bello
exhauriri3 et cum juxta pro urbibus agrisque sociorum ac
pro capite atque arce Italiae, urbe Romana atque imperio
geratur, aequum censuisse Neapolitanos, quod auri sibi cum

¹ ‘ That thereupon his explohs, and his glory. and the fact of his
descendants putting a hi her title on his statue, had easily brought

Compare Zumpt, ὖ 776.

’The modern editions read extremum, which is conjectural. the
manuscripts having tum. Medium is nearer tum, and is, besides,
supported by mature, for the end of autumn was the regular time
for prefiaring winter-quarters, and therefore could not be considered
as ‘ear .

³ ‘ At {he right time.’ The adjective according to Zumpt, ὖ 682.

⁴ ‘ Hannibal was brought (straightened) to that degree of famine.'
This is the manuscript reading-3 feo—redactus is a conjecture. Adeo
can govern the genitive as well as eo. Gram. ὑ 275, c, note 5.

’ ⁵ Not fuisset, because the untruth of the matter is already seen
in the connection of the future participle with the perfect subjunc-
tive of esse. See Zumpt, ὖ 498, sub fin. '

⁶ ‘For support in (adverse or mis-) fortunas For fortuna is a
verbum medium, and may be used either of good or bad fortune.

⁷ ‘If they thought that in themselves (in their persons, bodies)
they had any power of assisting the Romans.' Neapolis was a
civitas foederata, and did not contribute a cohort to the Roman
army; and the inhabitants (Greeks) here excuse themselves on the
ground of physical inability. In sese, therefore, is emphatic for in.

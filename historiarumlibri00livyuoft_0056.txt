42 T. LWil.

conspectum oculi ferebant, animo finivit,¹ tum lituo in lae-
vam manum translato, dextra in caput'Numae imposita,
precatus ita est. ‘Juppiter pater, si est sas hunc Numam
Pompilium, cujus ego caput teneo, regem Romae esse, uti
tu signa nobis certa acclarassis² iuter eos fines, quos feci!
Tum peregit verbis auspicia, quae mitti vellet.³ Quibus
missis declaratus rex Numa de templo⁴ descendit.

19. Qui regno ita potitus urbem novam, conditam vi et
armis, jure eam⁵ legibusque ac moribus de integro condere
parat. Quibus cum iuter bella assuescere videret non posse,
quippe⁶ efferari militia animos, mitigandum ferocem populum
armorum desuetudine ratus, Janum ad infimum Argiletum⁷
indicem pacis bellique fecit, apertus utin armis esse civitatem,
clausus pacatos circa omnes populos significaret. Bis deinde

¹ ‘ He fixed in his mind the sign opposite, as sar as he could see;
that is, he made up his mind and prepare'd himself to seek for a
sign in the quarter of the heavens opposite to him, and at the ex-
treme poiut of vision. The augur therefore directed his attention
solely to a part of the heavens in which an omen would be favour-
able, and did not at all observe the unluclty side. Those who take
advantage of the superstitious feelings of others generally know
very well how to suit their dicta to the wishes and likings of the
credulous. Such was certainly the system in the later ages of
Rome, but it may be doubted whether it was really in practice so
early as the time of Numa, when in all probability the augurs them—
selves believed in the truth of their art, and the observation of the
heavens was consequently more than a mere form.

² Equivalent to clarafeceris. Acclorassis is an old form of a rare
verb which is only used in this technical sense. Regarding the
form of the perfect subjunctive in assim-is-it sor overim-is-it‚ see
Gram. ᾗ 146, 6. The uti (ut) depends upon precor understood.
Acclorassis, being in the perfect for the present tense, expresses a
wish for speedy completion or fulfilment‚ exactly as the future-per-
fect indicative when used for the future. See Gram. ᾗ 338, note 3.

³b‘ He enumerated those appearances in the sky which he wished
to e sent.

⁴ ⁴ From thexconsecrated place ofobservation.⁷ See i. 6.

⁵ This pronoun being used here for the sake of emphasis, has the
sense of eandem. See Zumpt, <> 744, propefin.

⁶ See p. 36, note 3. “

⁷ The name ot'a part of the lower city near the Tiber‚ and after—
wards called Forum olitorium. The Janus was a gate, with a
statue of the god Janus in a niche, which connected two very busy
parts of the city, and the shutting of which greatly interrupted
traffic. Regarding this gare the belief arose that it could be shut
only when the Romans were at peace with all the world. It was
therefore shut very seldom, and only sor short periods. Numa⁷s
whole reign was peaceful. This was considered to be an historical
fact, which was commonly expressed thus, ‘During his whole reign
the Janus was shut? Now as all institutions relating to religion

¹ For in potestate, an irregularity usual in some public formulae,
but only sometimes retained by historians. Compare Grom. ᾖ 255,
1, note l.

⁸ See as to this city, ii. 9, p. 110, note 2. It seems strange that
the Latius in Aricia should have sought help from Cumae. a city
sar distant, and separated from them by the territories os several in-
dependent tribes, such as the Volscians and Ausonians; and it ap·
pears equally wonderful that the Cumans should have gone so far
from their own town into a mountainous district. The most probable
conjecture, perhaps, is, that the billows of Porsenna's power. after
rolling triumphantly over Rome and Latium, broke against the firm
walls oscumae; and that the Etruscan army, forced to retreat, sus-
tained another severe defeat near Aricia.
⁸ ² ‘ Who had rushed forward,’ equivalent here to ‘who had been
carried by their impetuosity by or past the Cumans,’ prae being
used in composition for praeter. Compare i. 45, near the end, infima
valle raefluit Tiberis, ‘ flows past.’

⁵ Love for their hosts and for the city.³

⁶ This reading, which is approved of by the learned Drakenborch,
gives us Horatius as consul sor the second, and Valerius sor the
third time. The manuscripts vary here, some ood codices having
the three names Lucretius. Herminius, and alerius. The ordi-
nary editions read P. Lucretius inde et P. Valerius Publicola con-
eules acti, which omits a year. Our reading makes Livy a ree
with laionysius and with the chronological fist of the consuls asti

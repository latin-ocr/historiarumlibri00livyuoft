g ² Cumae, the most ancient of all the Greek colonies planted either
in Italy or Sicily, situated on the coast os Campania, had become
itselfthe mother city of Dicaearchia (Puteoli) and Neapolis on its
own coast, and of Zankle (afterwards Messana) in Sicily. Cumae
was at this time (about 500 ne.) at war with the Etruscans, and was
powerful both by land and sea. Fifty years afterwards, it fell into
the hands of the Campanian Samnites, and was barbariscd, as Greek
writers say. It rose again to importance when annexed to the Ro-
man territory, but the only traces visible at the present day of the
once mighty Cumae are a few insignificant ruins.

'The manuscripts have omui sumptu, which could only be ex-
plained by means of a difficutt ellipsis, such as tracto or recidente,
‘whilst all the expense was transferred to, or fell upon the state!
As this ellipsis cannot be tolerated, we have, chiefly upon the au-
thority of Lipsius, made the slight alteration of sumptu into sumpto.
The sense is this: ‘ the monopoly of salt (salis vendendi arbitrium,
the right of selling salt as they chose, at their own price), as it was
offered for sale at an exorbitant price, was taken from private in-
dividuals, all the salt being transferred to the state.’ Livy speaks
os the salt which the salinae at Ostia furnished in great abundance.
When entirely in the hands of private persons, it was retailed to the
public at far too hioh a price; the state, therefore, undertook the
sale of it at a fixed and equitable price. Other editors prefer the
correction os Gronovius, omne sumptum, by which arbitrium takes
the sense of ‘the farming,⁷ which was let out (venibat) at a high
price, and which the state now took to itself; but both this mean-
}ng of arbitrium and the explanation given to venibat seem very
orced.

⁶ The manuscripts read educent, of which we make educerent with
more justice than educarent, the reading of other editions. Educm
refers to physical, educare to moral education.

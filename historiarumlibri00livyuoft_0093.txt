²By Asia we must understand. as usual, Asia Minor. and still
more specially the coast which was colonised by Greeks. Ephesus
and its temple of Diana formed properly the central point of the
Ionian colonies only; these, however. had in those times outstripped
the other colonies. Dorian and Aeolian. in the racc sor distinction
and celebrity. The original temple of Diana at Ephesus, which
was one osthe seven wonders of the world. was not in existence in
the time of Livy, sor it had been burnt down by the notorious Hero-
stratus on the night when Alexander the Great was born (in Sep-
tember‚ 356 Β. e.).

²The editions read cum laudaret. but the historical infinitive,
which the manuscripts give, can easily be tolerated.

³ On the Aventine. Diana, as goddess of the moon and of the
chase, was a leading divinity in Latium. and had a holy grove
,(nemus) in the districtos Aricia, from which has arisen in modern
times the little village of Nemi. Many Latins had been forced by
the last Roman kings to settle at Rome. and had incrensed, or, ac-
cordin'g to a more correct view, founded the plebs. This circuffn-
stance probably. more than a recognition of Roman supremacy, was
the cause osa temple being erected to Diana in Rome.

⁴ Livy seems to think that the Sabines stood in the same relation
to Rome as the Latins, though at a later period we find them in arms
against Rome, and in fact they were not incorporated with the Ro-
man state till 290 B.c., nearly three hundred years after this. In
the story, however, told in this chapter by Livy, we see only the ex-
planation os a sacerdotal legend. with the popular and natural. but
not very creditable. joy at the sly patriotism of the Roman priest.

⁵ Livy speaks here as is he were ‘ all of the olden time‚' and had
all the credulity of the early ages.

LJBER 11. 131

medium se gerendo nec plebis vitavit odium, nec apud
Patres gratiam iniit. Patres mollem consulem et ambitiosum
rati, plebes fallacem: brevique apparuit aequasse¹ eum
Appii odium. Certamen consulibus inciderat, uter dedicaret
Mercurii aedem.² Senatus a se rem ad populum rejecit:
utri eorum dedicatio jussu populi data esset, eum praeesse
annonae, mercatorum collegium instituere, sollemnia pro
pontifice jussit suscipere. Populus dedicationem aedis dat
M. Laetorio, primi pili centurioni,³ quod facile appareret,
non tam ad honorem ejus, cui curatio altior fastigio suo⁴
data esset, factum, quarn ad consulum ignominiam. Saevire
inde utique consulum alter Patresque. Sed plebi creverant
animi3 et longe alia, quam primo instituerant, via grassa-
bantur. Desperato enim consulum senatusque auxilio, cum
in jus duci debitorem vidissent, undique convolabant. Neque
decretum exaudiri consulis prae strepitu et clamore poterat,
neque cum decresset, quisquam obtemperabat. Vi agebatur,
metusque omnis et periculum,⁵ cum in conspectu consulis

 

opposite side (that is, the party of the creditors).⁷ We might also
suppose that Livy wrote praeci itaverat, this verb being often em-
ployed by him and other aut tors in an intransitive sense, for se
praecipitare, ⁴ to plunge, throw one's-self hendiong!

¹Aequare‚ with the accusative, ‘to attain or come up to some-
thing :’ in the same manner the compounds adaequare, exaequare.

2Ιι has been already mentioned (ii. 21. fin) that this temple of
Mercury was consecrated on the Ides of May (that is the 7th‚ ac-
cording to the Julian calendar). This day was afterwards kept
as a festival of Mercury, and os the guild or company (collegium) of
the merchants under his protection (Blercuriales). Annona is the
yearly profit derived from any merchandise, particularly from the
main article of trade—namely, grain: from this original sense comes
the meaning of ‘the market price‚' as it rose or fell. Thus cara,
arta, gravis, dura annona, ‘dearness,' moderata, laxa annona,
‘cheapness.' Pro pontifice is ‘in the place ofpontilex,' because the
performance of this religione ceremony properly belonged to the
pontifex (that is, here, the pontifex maximus).

3Ρνῑήιιιε pilus means, in the later organisation of the legion, the
first ofthe ten maniples of the triarii. It is doubtful whether, at
this early period, the legion was divided into hastati, principes, and
triarii, cohorts, maniples, &a We find this organisation in the
Samnite wars, but perhaps not before. But it is clear that Livy
means to designate this centurion as one of the highest rank and
longest service ; and it is not an unimeresting fact, that the dedica-
tion of a temple of Mercury, and the institution of a merchant’s
guild‚ which exclusively concerned the plebs, were committed to a
respectable plebeian, not to a patrician magistrate.

‘⁴ ‘ Higher than his rank‚’ fastigium being figuratively used of a
high position in society. ,

⁶ In most manuscripts the word libertatis follows periculum, as tf
the creditore had been in danger of losing their liberty; but as this

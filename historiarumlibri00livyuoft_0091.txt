² ‘Does not accord with the whole number aa settled by Servius
Tullius.’ Summa refers not to the sum-total os the cemuries, 193
(sor, as we learn from Cicero, de republica, ii. 22, it had remained
unaltered)‚ but to the number of centuries in each class, particularly
the first. Cicero, in the passage just cited, informs us that in his
time the number os centuries in the first class was not. as originally,
ei hty, but seventy. This change, which, however, did not materi-
εἰῇ alter the principle of the whole system, had taken place ‘in
consequence of the number os thirty-live tribes being completed,
and the doubling os that number (earnm—tribuum) by the centuries
ofthe juniors and seniors.' There were, therefore, seventy centu·
ries. seniora and juniors; not, however, as we have already said, of
the whole people, but merely ofthe first class. Thus the division
- ιο( the people into centuries was connected with that into tribes, and
as Livy mentions that the number os tribes had gradually been iu-
creased to thirty-five. at which it remained (expletus), he is naturally
led ιο speak of them as they were under Servius.

² ⁴ According to the inhabited quarters and hilis] Regio is a art
ofthe city with defined boundaries. ln these the colles are inclu ed,
but they are mentioned separately, because three os the four city
tribes were named after hills—natnely, the Palatina, Esquilina,
Collina.- the remaining tribe was called Suburmna. and compr-ised
the regio in the valley between the hills which we have mentioned.
The passage is usually written and pointed thus, quae habitabantur
partes, tribus eas appellavit, but our reading (qui, belonging to col-
liba-,³ as nearest, but also to regionibus) is that of the best manu·
scnpts.

³ Livy speaks only of the division of the city into four regions or

” tribes, and does not mention the country tribes, though we can have ’

no doubt that they were founded at the same time. He passes them
over, because he found conflicting statements regarding them '- the
annalists, and could not, or would not, decide which was to be de·
pended upon. In ii. 16, he mentions the addition of'a new (country)
tribe, and in vi. 5, he relates that sour new country tribes were
formed, and remarks that this compleres the number of twenty-five
tribes. It appears, therefore. that at the time os Servius Tullius,
there were at least sixteen tribus rusticae, besides the four urbanae;
perhaps more, however, suppostng that the Roman state had lost a
portion of territory between that time and the period when the
number oftribes amounted to twenty-five. Since Livy, as we have
. said. omits the country tribes altogether, and mentions merely those

os the city, he adds, · these (city) tribes had no connection with the
division of the whole people into centuries.y
